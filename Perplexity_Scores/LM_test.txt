103.50038808897976
When used preventively, it saves the state and the economy a great deal of money.	59.28887529159021
I have completely failed to understand in this debate why a reasonable set of rules was not adopted back in 1993, especially as the Commission and Parliament did not want any derogations even then.	111.90065794428719
Seven million workers were affected and specific sectors, such as the mobile worker sector, have been subject to ruinous competition over recent years, especially in Germany.	70.80333511714993
It is therefore also a social problem and it is not enough, Mr Crowley, to use tachographs or other technical aids.	43.52916702504553
One does not exclude the other.	13.176628015193167
We also need a framework directive, because the employees who are affected have been working in a grey zone for a long time now.	90.84465714270416
They had no rules, they were not covered by a collective agreement, they were exploited and some also engaged in self-exploitation.	89.21022772132443
We know that this overload sometimes gave rise to alcohol-related problems.	85.91238718663949
Parliament has shown sufficient flexibility; Mrs Smet highlighted our legislative maturity.	157.61871694432207
I think, Mrs Smet, you have proven that we can also fight.	20.814802375486053
The results are acceptable.	67.08039658634051
I am trying to muster support, even if we have not achieved everything we wanted to.	134.3353887453321
But the transition period and the graduated plan are the maximum we have allowed the Council.	58.70376024478094
I hope that no government will use up the full period of time and am counting on constructive competition between the Member States to see which State will be the first to implement the proposals from Parliament and the Commission.	94.37377301804719
Directive 93/104 was already very restrictive as far as worker production is concerned.	37.60930918620347
It does not harmonise social legislation upwards, quite the opposite.	66.27083910063186
It establishes a European framework which falls a long way short of workers' expectations: an 11-hour daily rest period, a 48-hour working week, a 24-hour weekly break.	91.3542075107655
What is more, a number of categories were excluded from its field of competence.	42.81788952943365
We find the compromise, which Parliament is to vote on today following the meetings of the Conciliation Committee, unsatisfactory in terms of both the health and the safety of workers.	42.768765878498115
It makes flexibility more widespread, particularly for sea fishermen, establishing the systematic annualisation of reference periods.	137.0750066739962
It will permit further exemptions to the already excessive legislation of 48 hours per week.	218.44256089474646
Finally, it will take nine years, in the best possible case, for the working week of doctors in training to be reduced from 58 hours to 48.	51.71621198631279
In fact, the proposed working time organisation institutes social deregulation at the very time when, in France, doctors in training are campaigning for decent working conditions and genuine safety for service-users.	87.91180205968786
Proper organisation of working time would entail, we reiterate, a real reduction in working hours accompanied by moves to create a sufficient number of jobs.	101.54657303953492
We cannot support this report as it stands.	73.55466331980266
Mr President, this proposal will bring an additional seven million workers in Europe under the protection of the Working Time Directive, allowing them to have reasonable working conditions and proper rest periods.	126.0011644814083
However, to get a 48-hour week, junior doctors must wait nine years minimum and possibly twelve years.	90.49169715372204
I will not pretend to be happy with this situation.	40.1284628343256
It is, however, the best that we could achieve if we were to end once and for all the Council's delaying tactics.	56.94593239363217
It has been obvious since 1993 that those excluded from the directive at that time would eventually come under its protection.	148.86830363232963
One has to ask, therefore, why over that seven-year period virtually nothing was done in Ireland or in Britain to bring the number of doctors forward that would be needed to implement it.	81.50202816838929
In Ireland some junior doctors work over 100 hours per week, the average being 70 to 80.	96.80687808627627
Only last night they suspended strike action which they had threatened because they have now reached an interim agreement which will ensure that they are actually paid for the overtime they work.	72.51679974173445
In some cases they were not paid at all, in some cases only half the normal rate.	93.94071743519548
Some progress has been made and no doubt the conclusion of the conciliation has helped them in that regard.	70.32892703478174
Through the Council of Ministers both Britain and Ireland fought tooth-and-nail to slow the process down.	15.010124585522336
That was unfortunate.	37.54882020315817
The working arrangements for junior doctors are like a horror story from a Dickensian novel of the nineteenth century.	27.882714159532465
I find it bizarre that at the beginning of the 21st century we are still arguing for common sense with regard to health and safety.	45.3500626519073
I would appeal to all national governments, including Ireland, not to utilise the additional provisions for extending the implementation of this directive beyond the nine-year period and would remind them that it is intended only as an exceptional measure if all other genuine steps have been taken to implement the measures here.	97.59925813051434
Mr President, the proposed working time directive for specific categories of worker such as doctors in training, offshore workers or mobile workers, is typical of the slow and derisory nature of social Europe.	40.48583853787537
The recitals of the proposal, nonetheless, stress the specific importance of this file, the first major file on social issues, adding, even, that it is a matter of the health and safety of 7 million workers.	53.24663428251356
In France, for example, a number of strikes by junior doctors recently drew the attention of public opinion to the intolerable length of the working day for this category of worker, harmful to the doctors in training themselves, but also to the quality of the care they are providing their patients with.	38.25798256770332
The same question arises, with at least as much urgency, for other categories such as offshore workers or transport workers.	110.19996387924182
What we should have had was a quick decision and an appropriate reduction in working hours.	93.11632523693756
Well, the proposal does intend to cut hours, but by phasing in the cuts.	75.12323321072073
For the first three years, 58-hour working weeks are permitted.	116.90596567296812
We have to wait 5 years for the maximum working week to be reduced to 48 hours, and the Commission is cynical enough to cite technical reasons in order to grant a further 2-year delay in application.	75.40202805785086
Who are they trying to kid that these measures could not come into force almost immediately if there was any political will to act in favour of the interests of the workers concerned rather than favouring the claims of management?	71.99495105663864
Some restriction, even a derisory cut, in working hours is better than no restriction at all.	63.21005659118195
We shall not vote against this text, but we shall conclude from this experience that workers can have no expectations of social Europe and that, decidedly, nothing can replace the collective strength of the workers when it comes to amending legislation in favour of the workers.	81.31296119642442
Mr President, the chairman of the European Parliament' s Committee on Employment and Social Affairs could not remain silent in this debate.	19.751255057831795
Thank heavens, my fellow Members have already said what needed to be said about the issue itself.	78.17791430719443
I shall come back to this point.	95.76119597661018
We are not terribly proud of the final result, but I should at least like to pay tribute to it, as some outcome had to be found.	46.52451387491975
At this point, I should like to thank Mrs Smet, our efficient and indefatigable rapporteur, and Mr Provan, who was also the persistent and efficient chairman of our Conciliation Committees.	40.2801770455476
I should like to thank all our coordinators, Mr Brok, Mr Hughes, Mrs Flautre, Mr Schmid, Mrs Lynne, who demonstrated great understanding in order to reach some sort of outcome.	45.989014594717126
I should like to pay tribute to the Commission. Without wishing to embarrass you, Mrs Diamantopoulou, throughout almost all this debate Parliament has had the technical and even political support of the Commission, particularly on the important amendments.	55.77093699607341
I have one small correction to make, unless I misunderstood, to what Mrs Smet has just said. It is not exactly the first successful conciliation on social matters between the European Parliament and the Council.	65.92758752039494
It is the second, following the successful conciliation on the minor issue of workers working in an explosive atmosphere.	63.05041229245381
This is, however, an infinitely more wide-ranging issue, of course.	17.15157042967843
Mr President, I must point out how unusually tough the Council is to deal with.	42.82243508951418
The political truth is that the Parliament team, in an astounding spirit of responsibility and unanimity - and you have witnessed the benign respect which I and Mr Bushill-Matthews, for example, have for each other - was remarkable for its united front as much as for its determination to succeed.	48.62832724517668
Parliament made most of the running.	62.18301442299582
We are not proud of the result in terms of the content.	17.87872963784285
In a real democracy Parliament would have been determining the legislation.	56.02214964575427
I would like to remind the Council that we are just as dedicated to achieving results, but that they must not expect Parliament to make quite so many concessions on a regular basis.	42.62508436928718
Mr President, I would like first of all to make three political comments.	80.8216762029796
I feel that the successful outcome of the conciliation procedure proves that where there is a will, there is a way.	52.60317127650155
In order for this conciliation to succeed, we had to take account of the fifteen different systems in the Member States, different fields of work and proposals from various employer and employee federations.	74.76398036918863
We also had to take account of the viability of health services as things now stand and competitiveness in sectors such as transport and fisheries.	93.71138604524548
This was no mean feat!	622.4619539419214
It has taken six years to achieve today' s result and it is the first major conciliation decision in the social sphere - and I say major because it affects some 5 million workers.	160.54492614654907
I feel that the most interesting point - and this is my third comment - is the number of workers affected by this directive, who are at present excluded from the working time directive and who will enjoy these rights once this directive is applied.	118.78624189539518
In my view, therefore, we should be satisfied regardless of whether or not this directive meets all our requirements.	80.09875048801801
The upshot is that the provisions of the working directive will apply to doctors in training, workers at sea, rail workers and all non-mobile workers in excluded sectors.	62.84017709227061
I would like in particular to thank the Chairman of the Committee, Mr Rocard, the Vice-Chairman, Mr Provan, who used his great experience to guide the conciliation procedure, and of course, Mrs Smet who, with her wealth of ministerial experience, helped achieve such a difficult conciliation.	52.334449074968894
I would also like to give special thanks to the Portuguese Presidency and the Member States, particularly those which, for reasons we cannot go into right now, have experienced major problems with their national health services, such as Great Britain, Spain and Ireland.	47.56704383389241
Certain speakers raised the issue of the implementation of the directive.	41.54067746295922
I should like to stress that it is indeed a particularly important issue.	43.361084064757705
One of the Commission' s fundamental duties is to monitor the implementation of directives.	24.834922498197187
Here I should like to ask the MEPs to cooperate with us and closely monitor any underhanded plans in Member States, so that the Commission can intervene immediately.	64.85391554669546
A further two questions have also been raised, the first by Messrs Hughes, Schmid and Pronk as to what we intend to do in the road and rail transport sectors.	52.01536678860845
First, I must tell you that the Transport Council is involved, making the whole process even more complicated.	46.03595407404133
Secondly, as for road transport, the Commission tabled a proposal in 1996, but it was blocked by the Council in 1998.	50.711284095089084
The Commission intends, with the cooperation of the French Presidency, to re-table the issue.	14.407641104887126
We are awaiting new negotiations by the social partners and we hope to obtain their assent.	66.6506699140038
If we cannot proceed in this way, we shall have to change the whole approach we have adopted so far.	53.27186767577441
With regard to the issue of fisheries, the matter was raised once again by Mr Hudghton.	46.70585949434243
We have discussed this in the past.	60.68268799327946
I will try to clarify it.	77.80840306981918
I am afraid I was not clear enough.	221.96167161598038
So I would like to repeat that the issue of self-employment in fisheries is not included in this directive.	34.90261880152722
The self-employed in fisheries is a matter of national competence.	51.1240930121109
That is very clear and very precise.	44.483071985094334
I thank you very much for all your support and help during these discussions, and that of your services.	107.9619717518698
It is very much appreciated indeed.	21.22300259073575
The debate is closed.	72.32022542053704
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.	47.382283419271545
Reviewing aid to third countries	129.489469973849
The next item is the Commission communication - Reviewing aid to third countries.	51.22596766261038
Mr President, I hope Parliament will excuse me if shortly after making a brief presentation I have to leave, but this is, as Parliament knows, very much the collective work of the RELEX Commissioners as a whole and very much the shared work of my colleague, Commissioner Nielson and myself.	73.4226397504083
Commissioner Nielson will still be here to make his own contribution to this report and to answer any questions which may arise.	59.68156248480451
The function I have to attend is a joint meeting of two committees which was specially arranged to discuss a number of external assistance issues so I hope Parliament will be understanding.	88.23063077568732
I think it is fair to say that the proposals that we have put forward go right to the heart of the issues that are raised in the White Paper on reform and it is extremely important for us to demonstrate that the reform of our external assistance programmes is the flagship or one of the flagships, for an overall reform process.	45.57118789494149
People occasionally get a little bored when one talks about internal procedures but what they should recognise is what we are discussing in these particular proposals: ways in which, first of all, we can get assistance to people more rapidly and effectively and, secondly, ways in which we can change the image of the European Union around the world.	93.50180737365477
All of us have, alas, experienced too frequently occasions when instead of us getting the credit for what we are trying to do on behalf of Europe's taxpayers, we get blamed for not doing it a lot more effectively and a lot more rapidly.	90.55642030523033
I hope that is a problem which we will be able to tackle.	25.129976285950654
Very briefly, it is worth reminding ourselves what the background to this issue is.	65.7961402610176
We have seen a threefold increase in external assistance commitments managed by the SCR over the last 10 years.	141.61929341722217
That has been driven by events and by political pressures; a recognition of the responsibilities we should discharge in Central and Eastern Europe - the recognition which that triggered of our responsibilities in the Mediterranean.	69.41320480020734
It is worth noting that our assistance programmes in the Mediterranean have increased four and a half times since 1990.	125.4220760938421
Then there is the Balkans crisis where the attempts to put in place a common foreign and security policy are being particularly tested.	45.76456970424414
While our external assistance programmes themselves have grown very rapidly, staff resources have failed to keep pace.	205.39008930341046
The Commission has 2.9 staff for every EUR 10 million that we manage.	96.09573827814025
That compares with an average figure about twice that for Member States - the figure is 5.7 but it goes as high as 9 for some Member States and 4.2 for the World Bank.	45.84431476597541
One of the consequences of that has been the increasing use of technical assistance offices which has been much criticised by Parliament and by the Court of Auditors on the grounds of weak monitoring and a lack of political control.	42.00854668968805
It is worth noting that we have spent about EUR 170 million a year on the 80 technical assistance offices which is equivalent to the cost of 800 staff working for the Commission.	76.1025971471262
A consequence of all this is that the SCR today has over EUR 21 billion in outstanding commitments awaiting payments.	81.02510398144244
That is an embarrassingly large figure.	37.76867851841927
I do not blame the staff of the SCR who work extremely hard in very difficult circumstances, but there are not enough of them.	61.075709617784575
They have had to operate with extremely difficult procedures.	142.9414249647944
They have also had to operate against a background of Member States second, third and fourth guessing every implementation decision that we try to make.	103.70219823933363
We have brought forward in the document, which has now been made public, our proposals for dealing with this problem.	36.704229919679776
As honourable Members will know, over the years Parliament has put forward a number of proposals including the idea that we should externalise the management of our overseas aid.	44.49887140128878
That remains a possibility for the long term though it would take some time because one would first have to get in place the necessary legal framework.	94.45609683199659
However my principal concern at the moment is not how we get from A to Z - that often seems rather easier than getting from A to B. What we have to do - whatever the long term objective may be is - to find better ways of managing our external assistance straightaway.	88.32413669100445
We have put forward a number of proposals. We have put forward proposals for improving programming: making sure that all the RELEX Commissioners share responsibility for programming - we have suggested the reuniting of the project cycle from identification to implementation - we think the present split has not worked well.	68.77131428462376
What we propose to do is to create a new implementation body replacing the SCR which we think should be called Europe Aid.	62.848928670036294
It would be initially an office under a board made up of all the External Relations Commissioners though, as I say, the option of moving to externalisation in the longer term remains on the table.	57.61605599675336
We want to devolve more responsibility to delegations and, where possible, to national authorities in the field.	42.13191968460973
We have proposed special treatment for the pre-accession strategy: humanitarian assistance and macro-financial assistance with fully integrated management.	167.89516058898593
That means, for example, transferring the residual SCR functions for PHARE to the Directorate-General for Enlargement.	14.308939922027312
We have proposed taking urgent measures to tackle the backlog of old and dormant projects.	78.18283031753897
We are writing to the relevant chairmen of parliamentary committees and to the Court of Auditors to explain our approach.	34.40220129883975
I do not want to go on for very much longer, except to say this: where will the resources come from to manage and run our programmes in the proposed office, Europe Aid, rather better in the future than we have managed in the past?	83.74652204975163
We have to take our turn with others in the Commission in arguing our corner in the peer group process for the assistance we think is required to manage our programmes effectively.	88.05716942396691
We may, as a result, present the budgetary authority with a rectifying letter to the 2001 budget proposals in September.	67.48606271708707
That is for the future.	18.183351615210675
The simple point I want to make is this: we cannot go on as we have.	222.1966806586945
In my judgement it is simply not an option.	40.78384151104104
We have to do better.	42.67882615627986
We are not bidding for a bigger empire.	15.000596842399993
The budgetary authority will ultimately have to judge the right scale of European Union external aid programmes.	105.79782042630096
However, my only aim is to put the Commission in a position where it can run these programmes competently.	79.42143713274994
I have to say very bluntly to Parliament that there are two possibilities: either the budgetary authority agrees with our ideas and will then try to implement them from 2001, or else, in order to manage what our programmes amount to more competently, we will be obliged to propose very large cuts.	80.02827322669717
We cannot go on in a situation in which we are not prepared to provide the resources to manage effectively the money that is voted by the budgetary authority for our external assistance programmes.	93.0657000624972
We have to be prepared to face up to the management and administrative consequences of what we are trying to do around the world, otherwise the people who suffer are those who should be receiving our help to enable them to read and write or live a better and healthier life or create the institutions of good governance in their communities.	78.24704564004318
They are the people who suffer as well as the European Union's reputation.	18.1426587608973
I am sure this will be a long debate.	104.35754088582202
I am sure that Parliament will have a considerable contribution to make to the discussion over the next few months.	75.46023658535468
However, my impression after a few months in this job is that Parliament wants as badly as the Commission to deliver a more competently run assistance programme all around the world.	115.02313632286584
Mr President, this is refreshing - the fact that the European Union is acknowledging that there are problems but that we have solutions.	17.196957527958244
Commissioner Nielson will recall that a couple of months ago I suggested that it might be the case that he could become an emperor without clothes.	55.10914501626051
Is it not the case now that this proposal, taking away so much from DG Development as it does, is likely to make my prediction come true?	94.32001236991206
Secondly, at the end of what Commissioner Patten was saying, I think he reiterated what he was quoted as saying in "The Times" this morning where he said that Member States should back his plans with resources or cut aid.	103.83417098899336
I have to say, Commissioners, that I find this a deeply worrying and dangerous statement and likely to be taken at its face value by Member States and not in the way that you suggest.	102.46810046270745
I would very much appreciate clarification of those two questions by one or other Commissioner.	245.1108159098551
Mr President, I do not feel like an emperor without clothes, but you can judge for yourself.	48.7193774498862
The situation is that we had to do something not just to integrate the project cycle in terms of the line management of activities.	51.72502255418871
We also had to do something concerning squaring the circle organisationally giving substance to my political overall responsibility for development policy.	171.8372453243578
We have done this without changing the portfolios that were defined.	93.35853196725611
The solution we have reached is to create a board of directors which will oversee and politically be the managerial part of running the new office or EuropeAid or whatever SCR is going to be called.	95.54306712656644
My role on that board will be that of the chief executive officer.	95.99523594838504
Commissioner Patten will be chairman, reflecting the position he already has at the head of the table being the ultimate coordinator of all RELEX Commissioners' activities.	36.806274206984206
We are in a sense structuring the political roles that have been defined and we are doing it in such a way that I think it really does have a chance of functioning.	65.58661931803616
There are two elements in this which will contribute to better coherence and better political consistency.	114.57909056437265
One is what I have already mentioned with a closer political involvement in the management of the actual implementation.	77.29325140568291
The other one is the quality-support group which will have its secretariat in DG Development.	47.71405408232949
The role is to make sure that the formulation of the different programmes, including those in DG RELEX, is consistent with the policy and principles that we have defined.	48.00371506065178
All in all, I think this is a good attempt at doing things given the way things were defined last July.	190.26711319791315
This will also concentrate a lot of attention among all RELEX Commissioners on the problem of whether or not we actually are delivering.	92.31787433193462
We have to get out of the culture of commitment and into the culture of delivering.	66.14731766297848
What we are doing here will be part of that change.	46.41769909856957
We also talk about ownership in our partner countries as being a major problem.	90.60466817642595
The reality, because of the way we are organised in the Commission, is that ownership on our side is extremely vague and problematic.	48.713731283904856
This is going to change as a consequence of the reform we are putting forward now.	55.09103671026611
Finally, I will address the issue of the risk of what happens if we do not get the staff and the resources to do the job.	39.0078965991192
Clearly continuing the way things are now is not acceptable, it is not possible.	92.38054915148473
We have to make the point as clearly as Commissioner Patten just did which means that we want those resources.	93.53599360936093
We have commitments, we have an agreement with 71 ACP states, we have the Member States backing that and accepting the next ninth European Development Fund.	23.788351599041388
All this is part of the promises we have made already, so there is really no alternative to getting the people to do the job.	47.14970678293836
But how to do it - this is a problem we cannot solve alone, which is why we are appealing as strongly and clearly as we are; and we make no secret of the fact that if the budget authority will not make it possible to get the staff, we will not be able to do the job.	44.910993418452065
This is the situation as we see it.	56.8885950692426
We do not want to invest our own role as Commissioners in fighting a losing battle.	53.215868253252495
We want to fight a battle we can be proud of participating in.	37.06982120376675
Mr President, I am very happy to hear that, in order to fulfil commitments, more resources and personnel are required.	70.11076299203987
As Parliament is aware of this, we will offer our full support.	50.06325181898009
However, I would like to ask a question, since I have not had time to study the document at length.	75.44547277342839
What will happen to humanitarian aid?	201.6035340629475
We understand that the Union' s policy of humanitarian aid does not end with simply granting it, but it has to continue - we talk in this context of a 'continuum' - so that development policies can be carried out.	88.72354085654433
Otherwise, we may see a repetition of what is happening in Mozambique at the moment: clearly, humanitarian aid was removed, ECHO disappeared, development policy is no longer being implemented and therefore, violence may erupt once again.	53.11089899937687
Within this 'continuum' I would like to know whether, as has been the case until now, ECHO will be an office dependent on the Commission, but whose action will be based on development policies aimed at what we want to see, and that is the eradication of poverty.	43.68771057730405
Mr President, it is a shame that Mr Patten had to leave so soon.	36.91165010678708
I actually wanted to put my question to him.	131.76169145817437
But I think that Mr Nielson is equally well placed to answer me because he has been standing by his colleague' s side and he also said that both Commissioners were responsible for the proposal.	68.09939965754923
Mr Nielson, of course we here in Parliament share your aim of providing quicker aid to men and women, and raising the profile of the European Union.	35.96305694226205
That goes without saying.	166.21479585761347
But we had all agreed that what the Commission wanted to introduce now by way of reform had to be done jointly with us.	104.1007284129196
When Mr Patten says in his presentation that either the Commission programme is accepted or we must make cuts, I find that highly displeasing.	124.62815458872807
It is we who are the budgetary authority, or at least part of it, and I think that the Commission cannot simply say we shall make cuts or we shall have to make cuts.	61.21568668071112
That, if you please, has to go through the budgetary procedure first and what is certain is that you will have to implement your reform programme jointly with us.	106.527522065051
I should like to know what your colleague meant by this threat.	56.89437221352732
Mr President, I am very sorry that Commissioner Patten had to leave.	69.0595508848959
In his absence I am delighted to direct my questions to the Development Commissioner, Mr Nielson.	172.02722049649324
I am delighted to hear of new innovations and reorganisations which the Commission is going to put into place.	61.65876742490972
EuropeAid would be a very important attribute of the European Union as far as our external relations are concerned.	27.725763295500176
It has been extremely embarrassing so far that some of our promises have not been kept.	38.226168663306524
Not keeping promises to the poorest people in the world is not the nicest way to go about - as a rich part of the world - trying to help them.	44.813454072435896
Consolidating the RELEX Commissioners and increasing the management support staff and resources have my fullest support.	123.54051039186011
I am also delighted to hear that they are planning to create a board very much like the World Bank.	141.84201575524025
But I should like to ask Commissioner Nielson if he has thought about something which is very important to this side of the House - the IFC in the World Bank has the ability to help in the private sector with funding.	37.71363624887772
Micro-credits and various other mechanisms are key to helping people to help themselves.	264.72749034096483
Have they considered extending, in EuropeAid, some element of helping people to help themselves through an investment arm where the European Union becomes a partner in venture and enterprise?	77.0618139608766
Firstly, ECHO is not affected by this reform of development assistance.	51.29634371430251
ECHO is going to continue.	15.969158730314074
This is clearly part of what we have decided.	35.0703581271497
The only issue is to create a better link or bridge between the phase of humanitarian assistance and the more forward-oriented, long-term development assistance.	94.52391204928153
This is a well established discussion.	138.22119847929335
We want to keep ECHO more or less the way it is.	124.47006569403412
I have confidence that with the new director of ECHO we are on track.	66.6808589750771
To Mrs Haug I should like to make it clear that Commissioner Patten was saying that we will have to propose deep cuts in the level of activity if we do not get a positive response from the budget authorities concerning the staff issue.	43.6171057931393
Why are we saying this as clearly as we are, even running the risk of being interpreted as if issuing a threat?	116.71288942260577
I noticed your choice of word there.	275.8824120362356
We think it is necessary to make it clear that we seriously think it is problematic to continue without the resources and the manpower that we need.	37.52656640571593
It is not possible to do this well without being more or less organised like other well-performing donors.	165.02295923232847
This is the message.	11.209393034993012
It may very well be the case that we are being misunderstood in this Parliament because, on this matter, we are definitely among friends.	33.8096889535208
So saying it as clearly as we do here may sound wrong.	227.23432230861243
I realise that.	1142.576217033753
But there are other elements around.	83.17975265333234
We have to say it à tous azimuts.	30.218839972369953
It is absolutely necessary to make these measures clear.	55.68637671387562
I do not mean to be negative about ministers of finance, but sometimes they can be quite demanding partners in discussion.	114.63183858420983
Development ministers are not that unproblematic either.	63.482790849596654
The biggest problem is actually the lack of consistency between the level of ambition defined in this field and the resources and tools that we have available to carry out the job.	35.93798181982961
This is our biggest problem.	25.309507621293236
We will be making a positive effort to get a solution that makes it possible to continue at least at the level of activity that we have now.	51.60839865928844
I should like to add that, though it is right to point out the backlog, the problems and the embarrassment, it should not be forgotten that we are building roads out there, thousands of kilometres in length; we are drilling bore-holes for clean, safe water, giving millions of people access to safe drinking water every year.	44.54177018584481
We are investing in people in primary education in a large number of countries.	36.80268960442696
We are making a contribution to the debt initiative second to none, even comparing ourselves with the biggest countries in the world.	52.50930706662894
We would welcome a little more competition as far as that is concerned.	76.53200634555544
I warn against giving the impression our development cooperation activities have all but stopped.	312.34405140803614
That is not the case.	14.430130895684675
We have to be realistic, clear and demanding in order to enter the primary league amongst donors and not to remain where we are right now.	71.00529241844457
This is the goal.	11.209393034993012
Mr Deva, we will, as part of the new Suva Agreement - the successor to the Lomé Convention - be including in our activities a EUR 2.2 billion private investment facility which will be administered by the European Investment Bank at arm's length.	36.91978743803431
It will deal with private partners, inspiring and helping the creation of business activities between European companies and business in the developing ACP countries.	74.41397862015465
This major innovation is being prepared right now on the same basis as you were talking about.	210.81271542183532
Micro-credit is a big thing but it is not the only answer to all problems.	40.776369886180724
However, we are quite active in this field also.	53.89150273834552
I thank Parliament for what I sense to be a more than positive reception because the critical notes that I have heard are of a kind that I would tend to interpret as enthusiastic support.	87.4654199744933
We should be careful not to end up facing a situation where there is a real threat of having to set our sights lower.	60.79552662485082
Thank you very much, Mr Nielson, for your optimistic view of the future.	32.612830188567976
Question Time (Commission)	8.295265269149338
The next item is Question Time (B5-0220/2000). We will examine questions to the Commission.	43.708556828627266
First part	2899.2137019435427
Question No 32 by (H-0433/00):	13.997010761389518
Subject: Jailing of opposition politician Xu Wenli in China Is the Commission aware of the recent trial involving Xu Wenli in China and the severe prison sentence that was imposed.	29.169468534819096
What action did the Commission take?	74.70663061705409
The Commission is aware of the recent trial referred to by the honourable Member in his question and of the sentence imposed on Mr Liu, who assisted Xu Wenli in setting up a branch of the banned China Democracy Party.	28.641871410882302
Xu Wenli, one of the founders of the CDP, was sentenced to 13 years in jail in December 1998, along with two other prominent democracy campaigners.	39.87911423766729
As the honourable Member will know, the longstanding policy of the Union is to raise the individual cases of Chinese citizens who have been in prison for political offences with the Chinese authorities, particularly in the context of the human rights dialogue, the last meeting of which took place on 25 February this year.	42.321444910131554
The Union has therefore raised with the Chinese Government the cases of Xu Wenli and others who have been trying to exercise basic rights that are specified by the United Nation's Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which was actually signed by China in October 1998.	35.138232936038655
To date, the Commission knows that at least 23 CDP members have been jailed for subversion as a result of their efforts to exercise those rights to which China is committed.	38.568474147937664
In relation to these and other cases, the Commission consistently calls upon the People's Republic of China to comply with the letter and spirit of the United Nation's human rights conventions which it has signed; to do so even before China's ratification of those conventions and actively to pursue ratification.	54.68353520489799
These efforts by the Commission will continue.	49.81857512509344
I thank you, Commissioner, for your answer and I should like to ask whether the Commission is aware that 14 months into his 13-year prison sentence Mr Xu is suffering from hepatitis and there are serious doubts as to the effectiveness of the medical treatment he is receiving.	62.86527167588597
I would seek an assurance that the Commission will enquire into this and ask the Chinese authorities whether they are providing the appropriate medical treatment.	66.33434757389898
Bearing in mind, Commissioner, what you said about your willingness to raise individual cases, could I also ask you to make enquiries about the fate of Rebiya Kadeer.	69.73006249804831
She was arrested on 11 August 1999 in Urumqui, the capital of the XUAR, while on her way to meet representatives of the US Congressional Research Service.	55.2226257879162
She was charged with providing secret information to foreigners and is believed to have been sentenced to eight years' imprisonment at a secret trial.	26.67078068335983
I will gladly provide more detailed information on that, Mr Commissioner.	58.75370119311571
It makes me even more angry that European Union Member States, faced with these cases and the 23 in general you referred to, show such spinelessness in refusing to support the US initiative in Geneva at the UN Commission on Human Rights attacking China's human rights record.	49.00073265770773
I should like to tell the honourable Member that in respect to Mr Xu, I will convey what he said about the apparently grave condition of that political prisoner to my colleagues in the external relations area.	68.33112799588045
I am certain that they will follow previous practice in making enquiries of the Chinese authorities as to the quality and consistency of the treatment of Mr Xu for hepatitis.	85.35078128791277
I know that my colleagues will be happy to respond to the honourable Member in order to keep him informed with any information they are able to obtain.	55.214608367522246
So far as Miss Kadeer is concerned, obviously I did not have notice of that question and am not in a position to respond.	65.30874166279317
The question will, however, have been recorded.	32.58519987510035
I will bring it to the attention of my colleagues and they will provide the honourable Member with the response he is seeking.	70.2610662417548
Obviously, it would be a matter of great concern if someone, whose only offence is to be antagonistic towards an existing regime, were to be the victim of insufferable treatment.	39.16854624013714
I know that my colleagues elsewhere in the Commission share this view, which I share with the honourable Member.	74.93284698330028
Question No 34 by (H-0357/00):	13.997010761389518
Subject: The Commission's reform programme and enlargement On 1 March 2000, the Commission adopted the White Paper on the reform of the Commission.	37.08554071767169
The measures and actions announced in the White Paper provide for a radical reform of the Commission which will involve a considerable amount of time.	66.40206504999443
Can the Commission indicate to what extent the present reform proposals take account of the forthcoming enlargement?	64.89066800126831
Do they anticipate the consequences which enlargement will have on the internal structure of the Commission and do the proposed measures and actions take account of such consequences?	91.53275051662261
If so, in what way? If not, would it not have been more logical for the Commission to take account of enlargement in respect of certain aspects, thereby avoiding a situation whereby shortly after completion of the current reform process the Commission has to enter into a fresh round of reforms to cope with the impact of enlargement?	43.16840524074689
Does the Commission intend to present an action plan with a timetable, as is the case with the present reform plan, in order to prepare the structure of the Commission for the forthcoming enlargement?	39.79254041586913
The Commission's reform strategy White Paper fulfils the undertakings readily given to Parliament and to the Council last year to give immediate attention to addressing the way in which the Institution, as an organisation, currently undertakes its duties.	53.67972809966196
Delay in designing a practical strategy and in pursuing necessary modernisation would not have been acceptable to the Commission, to the Council, to this Parliament or to the public, as I am sure the honourable Member understands.	66.43826089802397
One of the specifically stated purposes of comprehensive reform is the development of strengthened administrative performance which will, amongst other things, enable the Commission to deal more effectively with changes in the current and the future Union and in the wider world.	124.25731900751909
Clearly the challenges posed by the forthcoming extensive enlargement are different in nature and scale than those presented by any previous enlargement.	187.71532541243286
The Commission must therefore be capable of achieving the highest standards of executive and administrative performance in the discharge of its powers and duties in order to facilitate that massive and welcome development.	66.10203695431319
As the College of Commissioners made clear in our introduction to the White Paper, and elsewhere in that document, and I quote what we said: "the challenges of globalisation and future enlargement require better governance at all levels including the European Union".	73.78491883897412
All political institutions must rise to this challenge and so must the Commission.	177.61104232377158
Reform is therefore an essential precondition - a precondition for realising our vision of Europe.	30.25617022099094
The current administrative reform is not a limited exercise - it is an evolutionary process as we have made very clear - it will be continuously monitored and the results achieved will be assessed in order to provide for any relevant adjustments.	59.30980191465837
Proper account will be taken of any specific requirements that arise from the enlargement process, and naturally that will apply to human resources implications of the ongoing change.	119.70783122442386
Issues such as the management of the increased cultural diversity within the Commission and an early retirement scheme that is directly linked to enlargement will, for instance, be amongst those that receive particular attention.	134.52022632173538
As with past enlargements, specific measures concerning the appointment and integration of officials from the new Member States will be adopted at the appropriate time.	71.87859930065214
I would like to thank the Commissioner for his response.	23.513689914328882
I would, however, like to add something.	76.37422871190302
One of the main challenges in the enlargement process will be to tailor the veterinary and plant-health conditions prevalent in the acceding countries to those in the European Union.	26.958687186976558
Would the Commissioner be prepared to encourage observers from the Central and Eastern European countries that wish to join the EU, to attend management committees, scientific committees or any other committees concerned with veterinary and plant health, on a permanent basis?	76.48259543673998
Mr President, the honourable Member's approach to these and many other matters is I know extremely constructive.	126.21377881654814
What I know on the basis of precedent, and also the Commission's assessment of the scope and the depth of the challenges that arise from the forthcoming enlargement, is that appropriate measures will be taken at the right time not only in terms of the recruitment and integration of properly skilled staff from the new Member States but also to assist with the preparation of other areas of expertise - presumably including the Scientific and other committees.	45.56068638861105
To some extent, of course, the process will be assisted by the fact that the international science community inside and outside the European Union is genuinely international.	28.686111215545996
In addition to relying upon those casual professional relationships, I am sure that the Commission will want to ensure that there is continuity and access provided for those new incoming Member States not only in areas like those that he has mentioned - veterinary and plant health - but in many other areas where the smoothest possible integration of efforts is a matter of crucial and mutual importance.	112.08931580667269
Question No 35 by (H-0411/00):	88.29435930920096
Subject: Boarding of Community vessels by Canadian inspectors in international waters Five years after the seizure of the Estai, the Community fleet fishing in NAFO international waters has expressed deep concern at the boarding of a Portuguese vessel, the Santa Mafalda, supposedly by Canadian inspectors.	34.141275540286856
The Santa Mafalda, a vessel used to catch halibut, was boarded on 24 April last. The inspectors confiscated all documentation and refused to leave the vessel.	30.019593773161148
Furthermore, a launch belonging to the Canadian authorities has been tracking the vessel constantly, thus hampering its fishing activity.	30.827106879969417
A few days earlier, Canadian inspectors had apparently boarded a Spanish freezer trawler, which was also fishing in international waters.	78.35786775786389
European fishermen fear that the underlying aim of these boarding incidents is to deter them from using the fishing grounds in which they catch halibut and cod.	70.63609581661045
What information does the Commission possess on these incidents?	41.56538301321397
Can it clarify whether the inspectors were acting on behalf of NAFO or the Canadian Government?	61.60215566450669
Has it taken any action in this regard, or does it intend to do so?	156.7784253759731
Should accepting Community monitoring rules for inspections in NAFO waters prove problematic for Canada, what initiatives could the Commission take to set clear and binding rules which would allay the doubts of those working in the sector and the Canadian Government alike?	96.78994257075229
Thank you Mr President.	43.778379251518636
As the honourable Member who raised the question will know, in accordance with the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation scheme of joint international inspection and surveillance, each contracting party may assign means of inspection and inspectors to the NAFO scheme and NAFO inspectors may inspect any fishing vessel flying the flag of a contracting party.	56.0366569086964
NAFO inspectors are obliged to carry out their duties in accordance with rules set out in the NAFO scheme and they are also obliged to remain under the operational control of the authorities of their contracting parties and be responsible to them.	54.95058748330477
Against that background, on 23 April two Canadian NAFO inspectors accompanied by a trainee carried out an inspection of the Community fishing vessel Santa Mafalda which was operating at that time in the NAFO regulatory area.	30.999580085557923
The Canadian inspectors in question and the surveillance vessel from which the inspection was carried out are assigned to the NAFO scheme.	32.231003971046945
Their inspection was carried out under its auspices.	105.16384127114743
Having been informed by the Canadians, inspectors of the Commission boarded the Santa Mafalda to verify the grounds on which the Canadian inspectors based their citation of a serious infringement.	30.67379239434084
In conducting this verification the Commission inspectors ensured the security and continuity of the evidence on board and transmitted their report to the Portuguese authorities.	38.059866782715865
Those authorities in turn ordered the Santa Mafalda to the port of Aveiro in Portugal for a thorough inspection.	31.233495056943486
The Santa Mafalda arrived in Aveiro on 10 May 2000 and two Commission inspectors participated in a thorough inspection of the vessel.	33.596449144987645
The Commission has drawn the attention of the Canadian authorities to the procedures followed by the Canadian inspectors in relation to their seizure of documentation and their continued stay on board the Santa Mafalda.	38.41688334932207
The Commission takes the view that the Canadian NAFO inspectors in question acted in breach of the NAFO scheme by taking away documents from the vessel without the permission of the master and by continuing to stay on board the vessel.	48.00022196059913
However, it is relevant to note that in this case the master of the vessel and the Portuguese authorities did not oppose the prolonged stay of the Canadian inspectors on the vessel and the fishing activities of the Santa Mafalda were not obstructed.	20.69914796692852
Mr Commissioner, I am satisfied with your reply, but I would like to add something else.	95.20449586887626
The sea is a difficult world, and the Community fleet which fishes in international Atlantic waters experiences the interference of controllers and patrols from coastal countries which give the impression that, behind the harassment they sometimes suffer, there is one sole intention; to expel them from those fishing grounds.	48.78307488540078
The Commissioner knows, as I do, that the current situation in the NAFO is not, fortunately, what it was five years ago after the seizure of the Estai.	25.44388709235023
The European Commission - like the fishing sector itself - has made significant efforts to iron out our differences.	85.358095947451
However, there are still outstanding questions, such as the extraterritorial clauses, which allow the Canadian Government to carry out inspections, controls and seizures beyond their national waters, in open sea, which is incompatible with international provisions and which, all too frequently, involves the arbitrary application of controls within the framework of the NAFO.	42.49773621493716
For all these reasons, I would like to ask the Commissioner how the European Commission intends to defend the right of the Community fleet to fish freely in these waters, albeit within the existing rules.	30.122388060006955
Mr President, I am grateful to the honourable lady.	109.23924449422105
The only way in which we can actually ensure the proper maintenance of an international convention which has the effect of law is to demand on all occasions that the procedures required under the law are fulfilled properly in a balanced but a completely full way.	123.20411375899965
That is the position being taken by the Commission which is why I drew attention to the fact that the Commissioners have already reached the conclusion that the Canadian inspectors actually acted in breach of the scheme by taking documents without the sight of the master and by virtue, maybe, of their very prolonged stay on board that vessel.	38.366365950121406
The Portuguese authorities, as the honourable lady will know because of her interest, are now undertaking a full investigation and it would therefore not be proper for the Commission to communicate opinions beyond those I have already offered, but she can be absolutely certain that the Commission and its inspectors together with the Member States are vigilant in sustaining the proper rights of all vessels on the high seas.	62.999731111549615
Mr President, I had asked the question as a result of Mr Kinnock' s first reply, before Mrs Miguélez asked her question.	60.41157852480164
I had understood from Mr Kinnock that the ship was in fact being inspected in a Portuguese port and that this inspection had taken place in the presence of Community inspectors.	43.83041855498474
I understand, from his second reply, that he does not yet have the result of that inspection.	45.24872452574533
That is what I wanted him to clarify.	154.664795130688
If he does have it, I would like him to say so, but I understand from his second reply that he does not.	136.4932898613745
If that is the case I believe it would be prudent and logical for us to await the final result.	32.58600949107014
I would ask Mr Kinnock to communicate to Mr Fischler that, as chairman of the Committee on Fisheries, I would like to know the result of that inspection as soon as possible.	36.726156535842506
I would like to receive it because this Parliament will have to act accordingly.	48.29152299230943
In any event, I would like to condemn, in support of Mrs Miguélez, the abuse of authority on the part of the Canadian NAFO inspectors which Mr Kinnock mentioned.	20.714757902213726
I would therefore like to make that request and condemn this violation of NAFO regulations.	62.442539872562435
Mr President, I will draw the honourable Member's remarks to the attention of my colleague, Mr Fischler, and I know that they will be of interest to him.	51.45988325643862
He summarises the position precisely because the inspection has taken place and the Portuguese authorities are reaching their conclusions.	103.15142208997521
It would not be proper publicly to pursue the matter further, but when the report of that inspection and the assessment by the Portuguese authorities are available, I am certain that they will be communicated to interested Members including, of course, the chairman of Parliament's Committee on Fisheries and I am certain the honourable lady whose interest is manifest.	76.46405588112633
Question No 36 by (H-0415/00):	13.997010761389518
Subject: Need to support and strengthen the olive oil sector The implementation of the new olive oil regulation is having severe consequences for Greek producers who are poor farmers in infertile and island regions.	102.19076464330851
The abolition of the intervention price which had already been eroded has brought producer prices down to derisory levels: together with the co-responsibility levy this has had the effect of decimating olive oil producers' incomes.	63.56627541627245
The profiteering of traders who sell olive oil to the consumer at prices many times the producers' price have increased, and the small quota accorded to Greece in practice cancels out the entitlement to plant a further 3 000 hectares provided for in the new regulation.	106.29596652402898
Since olive oil is a basic product and the main source of income for farmers from the most disadvantaged regions in Greece and is also a staple of the Mediterranean diet, will the Commission say what measures it intends to take to protect olive oil cultivation and producers' incomes so as to enable them to stay on the land and when it intends to act?	51.756213577747744
Does it intend to increase the quota in order to cover existing production and the volume of production expected to result from the new plantations?	86.21824317301709
Will it reintroduce the institution of intervention, but improved as far as prices and the date of commencement are concerned?	64.8915018829034
Finally, will it draw up and implement an integrated and effective policy to promote and advertise olive oil both in the EU countries and in third countries, so that olive oil can occupy the place to which it is entitled - according to scientific findings - in the human diet?	80.16805761887987
Second part	2899.2137019435427
Questions to Mr Solbes	11.359914566280228
One of the greatest benefits of the question time arrangement is the way in which it endows me with instant expertise on issues as far apart as fishing, olive oil and human rights in China!	73.50302122679382
I am happy to respond to Mr Korakas.	115.04304644202871
In June 1998, the Commission undertook to present a proposal on the future of the common organisation of the market in olive oil to the Council and Parliament in 2000.	26.407195039464256
The new regime would apply from the 2001/2002 marketing year which, as the honourable Member will know, begins on 1 November 2001.	64.96607236012406
The Commission is currently studying new data on the structure of olive oil production in the various producer Member States, as well as developments in the world market where the Community is the leading producer by a considerable margin.	49.228898643623864
The study will also take into account the need to draw up an olive oil quality strategy in order to add more value to the product.	75.08366508475929
As far as product promotion is concerned, the Community is already financing promotion campaigns through the International Olive Oil Council.	150.81994332739086
Those campaigns appear to have a positive effect within the European Union and indeed in third countries.	51.05142707415833
In response to a specific issue raised by the honourable Member's question, I have to point out that the produce of new plantings would not give entitlement to aid.	68.73463897317693
However, the Commission hopes that the Community producers concerned will benefit fully under derogations from the rules as they relate to approved planting programmes, although the olive oil in question would count towards the maximum guaranteed quantity which has already been set.	90.60269396615824
Finally, the Commission wishes to point out that rather than simply abolishing the intervention system, what has actually happened is that it has been replaced by a system of private storage which is more flexible than the intervention system because it applies throughout the marketing year if the market situation calls for such support.	86.40149432822844
Since the start of the 1998/99 marketing year, it has not been necessary to pay private storage aid.	31.358774913201053
However, it is worth emphasising that over that same period the old buying-in intervention system would not have been activated either.	145.5085399106776
Mr President, we do indeed appear to be having problems understanding each other in this Chamber.	251.54632033283877
Because of the policies of the European Union, olive oil producers are truly at the mercy of big producers who negotiate among themselves and try to buy olive oil at unbelievably low prices.	56.87472817861608
This situation has reached dramatic proportions with the abolition of the albeit downgraded intervention system and the system of private storage, let me assure you is, quite frankly, a joke.	51.26843994021065
So how are we to deal with this situation?	62.788809871240645
Will an improved intervention system providing rudimentary protection for producers be reintroduced?	354.38323813361484
And given that, on a global scale, olive oil is so important to the human body and plays such an important role in maintaining farming populations in disadvantaged areas, why is it that the quotas, particularly for Greece, are so low?	81.05040901478974
Are you going to increase them?	88.611355154331
And with the widespread practice of mixing olive oil with sunflower seed oil, what does the Commission intend to do to put a stop to this practice, which is harming producers and consumers to the benefit of industrial racketeers?	47.293821685297125
In this spirit, does the Commission believe that this phenomenon can be tackled through guile, i.e., by increasing the quota for Italy, which is the main country responsible for mixing oil, and reducing the quota for Greece?	48.95549953622527
I am grateful to the honourable Member and I know of the deep concerns he voices. They certainly are communicated in this House and he does it in a most articulate fashion.	74.41137624701912
All I can say to him at this juncture, because I know this is a matter of continuing concern and activity by him, is that the CMO for olive oil is due to be reformed, as I indicated earlier, by 1 November 2001, following agreement in the Council and in this Parliament in adopting Regulation 1638/98.	65.7672858774258
I cannot assume that if the situation were precisely as the honourable Member describes, and smaller producers were in a dangerously disadvantaged position by comparison with the big producers, there would have been such agreement in the Council and in this House.	56.53188574609386
Therefore, I hope he will give attention to the results of the studies I mentioned being undertaken at the moment by the Commission, both in terms of the general questions he raised when he submitted his question and also in terms of the relative fortunes of big producers and small producers.	76.38863485236092
Finally, as someone who is merely a consumer of olive oil, I hope there is no extensive dilution of what is one of my favourite complementary foodstuffs and that, whatever else we do in the European Community, we strive together with olive oil producers of all sizes to maintain the maximum quality.	47.589137538659465
That is how we sustain our considerable lead in world markets.	224.30977635493213
Thank you very much, Mr Kinnock, for your cooperation during this Question Time.	53.84272346978105
We also congratulate you for using olive oil, which is very good for the health.	82.95478873723775
I also say this from a Mediterranean standpoint.	140.91398338071895
Question No 37 by (H-0409/00):	87.83507327176177
Subject: Further integration entailed by EMU In the Commission's estimation, to what extent do the requirements imposed by EMU on economic policy - which include permanently fixed exchange rates - create the need for further economic integration in the form of a more extensive common budget (a common fiscal policy), cyclical transfers between Member States, increased labour mobility between the participating states and/or a more flexible labour market?	88.92529610507106
The introduction of the euro will increase economic integration and reinforce the positive effects of the single market, primarily by eliminating the risks relating to exchange rates.	95.34292502157902
There are also other factors. There is greater transparency in prices, an improvement in competition and an increase in trade and investment both cross-border and also between other countries or areas affected by monetary union.	103.28830871681095
At the same time, as the common monetary policy will mean the same interest rate for all Member States of the monetary union, it will not only have an effect in terms of developing demand, but it will also mean greater integration of the financial markets.	62.74511401010088
This should also bring benefits for savers and investors.	82.3275162742527
For this to have the greatest positive effect, it is essential that we carry out a policy of rationalised public finances, which will not generate tensions in monetary policy itself, and at the same time, a decisive policy of structural reforms and a competition policy, which will allow the maximum benefit to be drawn from the process.	57.84149543469157
In order for economic and monetary union to function successfully, we do not need a major budget which will allow cyclical transfers in the event of difficulties.	55.87632361740294
I believe that the Treaty, supplemented by the Stability and Growth Pact, provides adequate instruments to implement an economic policy which is compatible with a unified monetary policy.	49.97817066105819
The basic framework which we have introduced is a framework of mutual supervision of national fiscal policies and of coordination of economic policies by means of processes to improve our structural situations and the coordination or creation of a positive macroeconomic environment which will favour growth and employment, and at the same time reduce the possibility of asymmetric clashes caused by economic policies.	122.65078586288628
Budgetary consolidation itself, which is, of course, the reduction of the public deficit, gives each Member State room to act in adverse situations.	43.81885125050892
Greater labour mobility may certainly help to confront the problems which may arise in the event of asymmetric clashes.	50.10838252212889
Both an increase in the available work force and an improvement in productivity would improve the situation in terms of creating jobs and helping to reduce unemployment.	92.76603446842614
That is why we attach particular importance to labour mobility.	78.82722443832573
The Commission has therefore insisted on its various strategies regarding the specific point of labour mobility, while remaining aware that this is a difficult issue.	90.07680743781881
It is difficult within Member States and it is difficult between one Member State and another, due not only to historical and cultural incompatibilities in terms of education, but also to a series of other aspects related to this type of situation.	46.47921514806334
Finally, I would say that clearly these difficulties which are being considered - and which may arise in the future - will surely be much less serious than those which have been brought up in theory by people who study monetary union, given that - and this is our experience to date - we are seeing an approximation of the economic policies of the countries and we have created room, in monetary terms, for us to confront difficulties more easily than in the past.	70.65223535698419
Thank you very much for your answer which, up to a point, contains many of the features I had expected.	63.9003592601215
I should like to follow up your answer and ask you what is meant by saying that the euro project will not be a success unless there is a large budget which can cope with fluctuations in the trade cycle.	66.87865960300525
What kind of large budget?	135.50712142694525
Is it a large EU budget which is being considered?	54.7021028864366
I should also like to hear whether it can be imagined continuing with a policy based upon recommendations and exhortations to the euro zone countries.	61.95342693085159
For example, Denmark has, in fact, on a number of occasions disregarded recommendations from the Commission.	26.745352232700384
Is this state of affairs to be accepted in the long term or will the Stability and Growth Pact be followed up and a stable environment ensured for EMU by adopting working methods of a type different from those involving recommendations and exhortations?	139.27823133494545
In your reply - or comment - I note two implicit questions.	243.3251933077106
Firstly, a major budget is essential to tackle the cyclical difficulties.	44.369791220332544
This would lead us into a very complex debate. The problems are not caused by clashes themselves, but by asymmetric clashes; asymmetric clashes differ depending on whether they are temporary or permanent, whether they relate to supply or demand.	55.08603127911536
We have little experience to help us define a typology and lay down a single formula for resolving these difficulties by budgetary means.	130.95267557776353
We believe that it is a much better idea to establish a general framework of economic health, of good economic behaviour, which will allow us to confront the difficulties in the case in question.	43.91959383356488
In the future we will continue with recommendations to comply with the stability and growth pact.	74.98973345164276
I do not know whether it is a good or a bad thing, but that is our obligation as the Commission.	51.630767041370675
This is an agreement adopted by the Council of Ministers as a result of initiatives by certain Member States and which I also support, since I believe that a good budgetary policy provides greater room for manoeuvre in the event of difficulties.	57.56602717158854
Earlier I referred to the fact that the situation is different in each of the Member States.	22.790167051832242
In this year' s recommendations we have taken particular account of the Commission' s own analyses regarding what the margins are, and which benchmarks we are setting in each of the Member States to tackle the crisis without exceeding the 3% public deficit, which is the figure we have established as a reference.	41.48582004729658
We can see that that situation is different in each of the countries and, therefore, our recommendations and our comments will always be different in each of the countries, although this is not the only aspect that we take into consideration.	66.00320780766165
Mr President, the current weakness and volatility of the euro is a cause of concern both within and outside the euro-zone.	48.348354591820204
Does the Commissioner feel that the current stability pact and the powers of the European Central Bank are sufficient to force the Euro-land states to make the difficult and fundamental adjustments in their economic and labour markets, which are essential if the euro is going to be taken seriously by the global financial markets?	45.91713806841233
I do not see any great correlation between the two questions, but I do note that the euro is being taken seriously.	74.51803208857955
What has happened with the euro?	27.758454424460655
There are many technical explanations as to why we are in this situation.	74.22768948108364
This would require a broader debate, focussing on the starting point, which is the development of economic forecasts and the real economies of each of the areas. It would also clearly concern changes in interest rates and certain other technical elements, such as expiry dates for certain types of issues etc.	67.52521736720243
The reality is that, by analysing the euro on the basis, fundamentally, of the evolution of the exchange rate, we are making an incorrect evaluation of its introduction.	26.836509057734844
The euro has been a great success, in terms of its introduction, in terms of issuing it as a currency, in terms of the consolidation of an excellent economic situation in Europe and in terms of the forecasts for the future.	21.83388708357727
It is true that the interest rate is not what we would have liked.	67.65952352828721
We believe that a strong economy means a strong euro.	176.27615920178732
We also believe that the development of growth in Europe will be strong throughout 2000 and, as a result, we will match US growth by the end of this year.	65.80224691546998
In these circumstances, we believe that the value of the euro will be rising in the coming months.	21.532833586641768
Therefore, despite a certain degree of concern - because that concern exists within public opinion - about the evolution of the euro, we believe that this situation will be corrected and that it should be considered to be temporary rather than permanent.	41.143614591081445
Mr President, in my opinion, the supplementary question by Mr Purvis was most pertinent, since recently the need for increased economic cooperation amongst the EMU countries has been justified by precisely this weakening of the value of the euro in relation to the US dollar.	49.562839012755376
The reason for the dollar becoming stronger in comparison to the euro is simply that the national economy of the USA is stronger than that of the euro countries.	53.527712798908695
Hundreds of thousands of new jobs have recently been created in the USA, while the number of jobs in Europe has been cut.	43.075466136863724
I would like to ask the Commissioner firstly, whether the Commission admits that the weakening of the euro that has been much thrashed out in public, is a consequence of the infrastructural problems and lack of dynamism of the EU economy, particularly in relation to the USA, and whether he really believes that the kind of Keynesian action as proposed by Mrs Frahm would be the cure for this weakening of the euro, and whether he believes that the Commission will achieve better results in this matter, when the national governments of France and Germany have actually proceeded in the totally opposite direction, and their actions have weakened even further the competitiveness of the euro area.	36.97467066983957
As an example, I refer here to the decisions made by the French Government on working hours.	49.83366567190978
I will try to reply briefly, although these are complex questions and I will therefore have to give this point some attention.	100.61265442578156
Firstly, with regard to increasing cooperation in terms of coordinating economic policies, I believe that it is necessary and positive and is one of the elements which is emerging from this current crisis.	52.75854306296136
The French President has highlighted this and it will obviously be a point for debate during the next presidency.	59.679595751126286
I do not agree with the theory that the euro' s development is leading to a fall in employment in Europe and an increase in employment in the USA.	37.665266590580984
Transfers of capital may generate additional activity in the United States, but the positive increase in exports is generating activity in Europe.	73.071116092014
It would require a very complex and profound debate to deal with this issue.	54.94101763929663
In any event, what I do believe - as I said earlier - is that the euro, at the moment, has an exchange rate which, if we analyse it in relation to its components and its historical situation, is not that different from situations which have existed at other times.	79.90831323467319
I am convinced that this is a transitional situation which will improve during this year.	60.64165651409469
Question No 38 by (H-0419/00):	13.997010761389518
Subject: Precarious employment and the industrial-accident rate in Spain and in the Murcia region At the Lisbon Summit, a commitment was made to achieving full employment in proper jobs throughout the EU.	59.34030823837682
In response to the French Government' s proposal involving a reduction in working hours in order to create more proper, stable jobs, the approach agreed between the Spanish and UK Governments, which calls for further deregulation of employment conditions in order to increase the number of jobs, has been adopted.	40.895089600949106
Spain' s experience over the last four years has demonstrated that jobs are indeed created but are predominantly casual and precarious in nature, and they are associated with a high rate of industrial accidents, the Murcia region being the part of Spain where that rate is highest.	92.30578484034005
Does the Commission not think that there is an urgent case for monitoring the conditions under which jobs are being created in the various EU countries and regions, so as to ensure that job-creation is not at the expense of the stability and dignity of workers and especially of young people entering the job market for the first time?	50.55919689960323
Questions to Mr Verheugen	11.359914566280228
Mr President, despite the fact that I was born next to the Murcia region, it is difficult for me to analyse, in Community terms, the problems of the precarious employment there.	33.44877179988522
Therefore, allow me to make a rather more general comment.	91.82705734310903
The assessment of the labour market reforms which have resulted from the processes we have established in the Union - the Luxembourg process and the broad guidelines for economic policy - demonstrates that the reforms of the regulations on the labour market in the different countries are making a positive and significant contribution to greater economic growth and to promoting the creation of employment and the greater participation of men and women in the labour market.	57.378363105917025
The broad guidelines of economic policy and the recommendations for employment have never advocated a simple deregulation of the labour market, as the question states.	90.19113877592714
Together with the reform of certain labour market regulations, they also include, for example, the need to adopt measures which will promote entrepreneurial spirit or active labour market policies - and we state this quite deliberately - to improve employment opportunities.	104.92103049435961
The measures adopted in each Member State must be adapted to the problems and reality of each of them.	42.87867024297828
It is also quite normal for the Commission to insist on the need to hold debates and make agreements with social partners so that they may actively participate in the changes to the labour market in each country.	75.17811953107365
As well as a significant and lasting increase in the levels of employment, one of the key priorities of the employment strategy is to improve the quality of jobs.	42.505709233134
The recent Lisbon Summit gave a new impulse to the Union' s economic and social agenda and we have also insisted on this point by talking of more and better employment.	71.92528551774897
I would also like to highlight, as a fundamental contribution to the consolidation of the progress made until now, the promotion and maintenance of rigorous regulations on health and safety at work, which has been one of the most prominent issues in the debate held in the Commission, which advocates better jobs in Europe.	51.42228383705341
Labour market reforms directed at improving employment opportunities and workers' ability to adapt to these new opportunities in no way seek to undermine working conditions or health and safety at work.	178.9264245778236
In accordance with its legal competence as laid down in the Treaty, the Commission has kept up the necessary efforts to implement and propose various legal instruments and monitor the incorporation of the acquis communautaire in this area.	89.8060050051048
With regard to your specific question and the case of Spain, it is Spain' s responsibility, like the other Members, to apply the Commission' s directives.	51.411555660073105
It is also the responsibility of the Member States to monitor the application of these directives in all of their regions.	29.591135081023356
The Commission must guarantee that those directives are transposed into national law correctly and, clearly, to monitor all the issues relating to its application, which is the responsibility of the national authorities.	57.815809258264046
I am grateful to Mr Solbes for the intention behind his reply, which is to safeguard and show concern for worker' s conditions.	144.77958895933898
Nevertheless, the political analysis of the Lisbon Summit reveals that there were two proposals: one which was more social, more committed, which came from the French Prime Minister, Mr Jospin, and the other, resulting from a previous agreement between Mr Blair and Mr Aznar, deregulating the labour market and making it more flexible. The latter proposal won the day.	43.895493865324234
If we take Spain as an example, it is clear that job instability, temporary employment and work accidents are on the increase.	44.56379860371131
Do you not therefore believe that it would be appropriate, in the review of the Treaty of Amsterdam, to incorporate the Social Charter with specific instruments and measures, as occurred with the five classic points of the Treaty of Maastricht, in order to guarantee full employment and employment quality and that it therefore not be left to the whim of each of the countries?	30.58310248084749
By way of clarification, reference has been made to the number of work accidents in Murcia because it has such a sad record within Spain; that is why we are concerned.	50.34625050268419
I imagined that was the reason for the reference to Murcia, and not the fact that I was born next to that province.	54.78974703155912
With regard to the basic problem, I would make a different comment.	47.38491225236539
Our concern has always been not only greater employment but also greater quality of employment.	112.6823384590932
In the broad guidelines for economic policy for this year, and in the specific recommendation for Spain, we expressly refer to the need for the problems to be analysed, amongst them the cost of dismissal, which may be important with regard to temporary employment, because we believe that a distinction should be made between precariousness and flexibility, which are two very different things.	40.67337898670874
Nevertheless, you introduced a second element in your supplementary question which, in my opinion, is of great interest: Why do we not establish the objective of full employment in the same way that we established the objectives of the Treaty of Maastricht at the time?	51.48268263977071
Basically because they are two completely different types of figure.	107.12488679901924
At Maastricht, what we put in place was compliance with obligations dependent on voluntary decisions adopted by the Member States which form the European Union.	60.11253990434322
In the case of full employment, the figure is the consequence of measures which are intended to achieve an objective, but which do not have a causal relationship which guarantees its objective.	47.887453279000425
What we can consider is what is being done in the various employment programmes, and that is the implementation of certain elements which will allow us to move towards full employment.	57.48337209488147
When we spoke of full employment in the Commission document which served as a basis for the debate in Lisbon, we expressly said that if we add the development of the economy in accordance with currently available figures to the various determining factors and policies proposed by the Commission, full employment will be achieved.	74.06971639233095
However, this cannot be a political objective, as in Maastricht, because it does not depend on the will of the different governments or on a specific decision by each one of them.	68.57413290392637
I would like to say that, in order to judge from afar, it is often necessary to understand the reality.	30.59117254467784
In the countries of the Southern Mediterranean, and specifically in the region of Murcia, they have, in recent years, stopped managing unemployment and started to manage employment.	39.304679375949355
They have moved from an extraordinary and terrifying level of unemployment, originating in the great state industries whose economic model was unsustainable, through a crisis and then to a situation involving the growth of small businesses (SMBs) and economic incentives which have generated a new and vibrant model.	60.014838347807476
However, it is clear that accidents in the workplace - which I am now talking about - are a problem of education and mutual responsibility on the part of businessmen, the state, public administration and, of course, trade unions.	45.52592692770843
Unless they all work in unison, they will not achieve this objective.	70.39737508372096
In Spain, back in 1995, a law was adopted in this respect, and they are trying to comply with it, but this cannot be achieved in a day.	40.903320554078576
Therefore, Commissioner, firstly, what active policies and which economic sectors do you intend to bring into play in order to achieve better education in this particular area, so that a sense of responsibility may be developed?	89.96465178925924
Secondly and very specifically: is there any programme to educate immigrants in the language of their host country, so that we can educate them to understand the minimum safety standards in this region which is host to many immigrants who do not speak our language?	63.98956662398849
Thank you for your comments.	69.90704851841531
With regard to your questions, I will say again that the distribution of responsibilities between the Commission and the Member States dictates that these matters fall to the Member States.	49.297174642407796
Consequently, both the funding of these immigrant education programmes and the active policies are decisions which logically depend on which social policy the Spanish Government accepts or decides on.	72.2770289879953
Question No 39 by (H-0352/00):	13.997010761389518
Subject: Adaptation of the applicant countries Will the Commission indicate the total number of documents that have been sent to the applicant countries as well as the total volume of the 'acquis' and will it consider forms of cooperation that do not require the applicant countries to accept every rule?	59.86060985835447
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the entire Community acquis, i.e. all the legal acts of the European Union without exception were sent to the candidate countries immediately after the resolution of the Luxembourg European Council in December 1997, during the course of screening.	39.177640218443194
No-one has ever counted them and I cannot therefore tell you how many there are.	171.97104391268215
We usually talk of just over 20 000 legal acts in this context.	220.54057698004428
Mr President, there is not very much to thank the Commission for.	20.99676574803584
I find it completely incomprehensible that there should be an institution which is unable to put together elementary statistics concerning the existing rules, which is unable to add up how much money is being sent to the candidate countries, which is unable to provide some general numerical information so that ordinary people can follow what is happening and which is unable to supply the total acquis on a CD-Rom to anyone who might be interested in it.	84.72254041824206
It is really quite simple. I have worked on it for a good many years.	105.16523389056516
It is completely impossible even for organisations with academic employees to find out how extensive the 'acquis' is, and it is apparently impossible for Mr Vanhengen to give the entire acquis to a Member of the European Parliament who is quite prepared to go through it and distribute the tasks among the different employees in order to see what positions are to be adopted on its various aspects.	69.58007354576365
So there is nothing to thank the Commission for.	25.13413127467293
Mr President, Mr Bonde, we have met each other face to face here before, and I personally am having to exercise a great deal of self-control in order to maintain the necessary degree of decorum in the House.	69.71967872997176
The legal acts which we are talking about here are legal acts passed by the Council, by Parliament, by the Commission and by all the Community institutions.	72.21042454895576
You, as a member of the most important legislative institution of the European Union know full well that these legal acts have not been numbered consecutively.	82.56331713302316
I do not know of a single Member State of the European Union whose laws are numbered consecutively.	29.96761021832273
Even the laws in your country - and I have taken the trouble of finding out - are not numbered consecutively.	52.95692255396288
If you think that Commission officials are well employed if I sit them down and tell them to spend a week counting the legal acts issued since 1955, then let me tell you that I do not.	131.67803198543953
I have no intention of arranging for them to be counted.	31.33059480581524
The information which I have given you is as accurate as possible: i.e. that candidate countries are sent all, I repeat all the legal acts of the European Union without exception.	93.80408793272899
I am curious to know how it helps if I tell you that this figure is 21334 or 21425.	67.12644056491011
If you want, you sit down and do it. You can find the entire Community acquis on-line on the Celex website here in Parliament.	66.02686470009806
You tell your employees to count these legal acts, because I shall not tell mine to do so.	157.0034417448654
Mr President, Commissioner, the acquis is, of course, an important basis for accession.	27.021378856302015
Can you tell us how acquis screening is proceeding in your view?	159.68273412614468
With which candidate countries has most progress been made?	299.4895596341334
Which chapters have been completed?	12.8626536990729
Chancellor Schröder recently stated in a press conference that the first admissions will probably be in 2002.	90.14239834642589
How do you assess the scenario if the legal inventory is completed in optimum time?	27.05582676096631
What do you think is the earliest possible date for accession if optimum use is made of all deadlines and options?	103.83351362054024
I can tell the honourable Member that screening - i.e. legislative adjustment - was of course completed with all candidates some time ago.	57.77571853059582
It is updated now and again because the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission are not idle and continue to produce legal acts, meaning that the acquis changes.	50.084809924633426
This amended acquis must, of course, be included in negotiations.	246.01938047919467
But this happens on a regular basis.	31.862276764174794
The screening process has therefore been completed with all candidates.	41.946316197416486
Your question is based on a misunderstanding.	55.7065400074767
Screening is not the same as negotiation, screening is merely an adjustment process.	34.90133906286257
Screening is used merely to identify the acquis of the European Union and how much of it already forms part of the candidate country' s legislation and how much does not.	114.00395191433013
That has been done.	12.95709104304057
Now you want to know how far negotiations have proceeded overall.	84.58394358463885
I know that for the Luxembourg group of countries, with which negotiations started in March 1998, between 10 and 15 out of a total of 31 negotiating chapters have been provisionally completed.	119.66725879304609
A few more will be completed during the Portuguese presidency.	68.39835764574812
But more important than the number of chapters completed is probably the number of chapters opened.	35.399048535058036
By the end of the Portuguese presidency, all 29 chapters will be on the negotiating table for the Luxembourg group of countries.	28.545260728617777
Only the chapters entitled "Institutions" and "Miscellaneous" are still closed for obvious reasons.	105.75484181251821
They come at the end.	63.331435350599165
With the Helsinki group of countries, negotiations did not start until February of this year.	51.4882843918636
Between 5 and 8 chapters will be opened for these countries during the Portuguese presidency.	65.95223046207673
Indeed, I think that we will be able to provisionally close a whole series of chapters by the end of the Portuguese presidency, but we cannot yet forecast how many with any degree of accuracy.	44.66276703210407
In all events, the process is proceeding apace.	34.50852649862344
It is quite impossible to forecast when the negotiating process will be completed and when the first accessions will take place.	36.94056740399451
There have been intensive discussions on this over recent weeks and months.	68.51987668157054
The Commission stated quite clearly in Helsinki that an accession scenario could not be developed until all the information needed was available.	133.2267076362492
We need to clarify if the Union itself is ready for accession, i.e. if the institutional reforms have been completed, how far negotiations have progressed and, most importantly, and this will be the most difficult exercise at the end, if a candidate country is judged to be in a position to really apply and implement the acquis it has adopted.	87.38218302719629
As things stand today, I am bound to say that we cannot forecast when such a scenario will be ready.	81.50202154077523
I have said on many occasions that I would like it to be ready by the end of this year, at the Nice summit.	41.68069491686385
But whether or not that will be possible will only become apparent in the autumn of this year once we have the up-to-date progress reports on preparations for accession for each individual candidate country.	98.22319934555114
Mr President, Commissioner, my question does not concern the timetable; instead I would like to ask a question regarding a principle of enlargement.	54.845368839082774
The process of enlargement is expected to be a truly demanding one, in which there is a danger that we either become frustrated by long waiting times or compromise over the criteria by granting overlong transition periods, which will naturally cause displeasure in the old Member States.	109.22184777554685
An arrangement such as the EEA agreement may be regarded as a solution of the past, but I would nevertheless like to ask, whether the Commission could, even in principle, consider a possible solution along the lines of the EEA agreement - not as it stands but of that nature - to be used as some sort of ' hatchery' or incubator for the new Member States prior to actual membership, instead of the applicant countries having to wait for long periods of time before permanent membership becomes a reality. I would further like to ask, whether the Commission shares the view that this kind of arrangement, along the lines of the EEA agreement, could considerably reduce the costs of enlargement and promote the economic development of the applicant countries.	63.550433837464205
I hope this question was not an improper one at this time.	94.97244202998459
Madam, what you wish to engage in now is a hypothetical discussion.	43.42113260306065
This discussion was held in the first half of the 1990s and it culminated in resolutions of which you are aware, which were discussed on several occasions in Parliament and which can no longer be made retroactive, namely the resolution of the European Councils of Copenhagen, Essen and Luxembourg to prepare the Central and Eastern European Countries and Cyprus and Malta for full membership.	31.17399513299476
There is no point today in debating whether or not there might have been an alternative.	170.23221487734637
In any case, it is my recollection that the candidates were not satisfied with anything less.	61.54133905387822
They would not have accepted less and would have seen it as discrimination, meaning that, in Luxembourg in 1997, there was no longer any realistic alternative to the resolution taken in any case.	88.31814731504525
There is not a single country involved in the process which takes the view that we should depart from this objective of full membership.	58.122231263221934
If there were, I would know about it.	81.17163241103951
But there is not.	16.027610473836553
All 12 countries with which we are negotiating are seriously working towards the goal of full membership and I urgently advise you against opening a debate on changing the fundamental objectives of enlargement now that the process has begun.	185.26739079555927
The candidates will only see it as a serious breach of trust.	34.22202835804994
Question No 40 by (H-0388/00):	63.60228565305425
Subject: Eastward enlargement: transitional arrangements regarding the free movement of services Negotiations with the first group of applicant states (the 'Luxembourg group' ) on the free movement of services have reached a provisional conclusion.	47.680566406047056
What transitional arrangements have been agreed to date?	48.74039397836939
What effects does the Commission expect these to have on small businesses and self-employed craft workers, particularly in the regions bordering on the applicant states?	84.61925684696365
Questions to Mr Monti	11.359914566280228
Mrs Müller, the question is based on an erroneous premise.	27.372290756621915
The chapter entitled "Free movement of services" has not been provisionally completed with any candidate country.	51.03649209060606
Nor do I expect this chapter to be completed with any country in the immediate future.	61.15464291593129
Mr President, it is certainly correct to say, Mr Verheugen, that the chapter has not been completed, but negotiations have started.	32.800851060915605
However what I am interested in is this: Have transitional arrangements in the area of the free movement of services been applied for during these negotiations?	138.21416647034113
You know, I am from a border region and I know exactly what the situation is on the ground.	181.85327459144716
I am convinced that medium-sized companies and the craft industry will face huge problems and enormous challenges when it comes to the free movement of services, because there is a huge wage differential of 1:10 at present.	59.032536605909414
You yourself know full well which industries are affected.	1040.1045726724817
Is there any intention on the European side to apply for transitional arrangements in the area of the free movement of services?	62.54912711277732
The Czech Republic has already applied for transition periods for the acquisition of land by foreigners and this will have an impact on services.	34.50748204728937
What is your position on the transition periods which the Czech Republic has applied for and what is the Commission' s position in general on this point?	40.69041455180352
Mr President, Mrs Müller, I assume that you know that accession negotiations take the form of a state conference at which the Member States, not the Commission, negotiate and I am not therefore entitled to divulge the content of negotiations which have not yet been completed.	60.170429417584806
I would gladly do so, but I am not allowed to.	190.87267615494005
However, I can still answer the question, because the Commission naturally has an opinion on the points which you raised.	101.17311879894737
First, the Commission takes the view that transition periods should only be considered during the enlargement process if the aim of enlargement cannot otherwise be achieved within the required time or by the required date.	99.65749745866984
Transition periods must be very, very limited in both scope and duration, especially where the internal market is at stake.	55.879252939943726
You must know that every transition period, irrespective of whom it benefits, suspends the internal market for that area.	37.983943969277895
And if a large number of transition periods are agreed, then we can forget the whole idea of the internal market for years to come.	38.74970264766637
That cannot be the meaning of enlargement.	52.27144528106021
The question which you actually want answered is the question of how we can prepare for the problems which will arise in certain border regions following enlargement.	126.71518480653904
The region which you come from and the region which I come from are just such regions.	199.34710712272428
I have discussed this matter on many occasions in your country, as you know, and so I can be brief.	65.87270323706565
I think that there may well be transition periods in relation to the free movement of workers, which is the really difficult question.	42.50329793693889
But we have not yet reached that point.	42.641881690685274
In the area of the free movement of services, which will lead to stiffer competition in border regions, I think that we need to start preparing an action programme right now, particularly so that small and medium-sized enterprises in border regions will be capable of adapting to and withstanding this new competition.	65.65303976061146
When, a few weeks ago, I once again read the Commission' s progress report on Lithuania, it occurred to me that the progress reports are being produced as if it were the previous enlargement we were talking about, that is to say the enlargement which took place before the Treaty of Amsterdam came into force.	95.35522135811135
The Social Chapter is the corollary and counterpart of free movement of services and labour mobility.	27.410291290940094
My question is about whether the forthcoming progress reports will, to a greater degree than the previous reports, take account of employment and of the Social Chapter, which is now a part of our 'acquis' .	78.5634468346825
I believe, in fact, that we can succeed in enlarging the Union if we combine these two aspects: firstly, the free movement of services and employees and, secondly, more equal conditions when it comes to the dialogue between employers and employees.	40.76997819505637
The Social Chapter is, in fact, a part of our common regulations, with which the candidate States must also comply.	35.99470433063318
I would like to remind MEPs in general that questions during Question Time must be specific questions on specific issues, which lead to specific answers.	99.51694703910354
Everything else must take place during the normal debates of the parliamentary committees, because, otherwise, the MEPs who are due to follow will not be able to put their questions.	43.75606461235928
Having given this general warning, I give the floor to the Commissioner.	83.16875071637882
Mr President, to be honest, the underlying question was how many legal acts does the European Union have.	78.47242677731944
Now I am being asked to answer a supplementary question which very specifically concerns one candidate country.	308.9982608466809
I really cannot see the connection between these two questions, except that both relate to enlargement.	112.55002049179036
However, if you take the view that there is a connection, then I am prepared to answer the question and am able to do so.	69.4574877621995
All the acquis is taken into consideration in the progress reports on the candidate countries.	104.5510848593246
The Charter of Fundamental Rights cannot be taken into consideration because it is not yet ready.	24.070700924105367
It is only now being drafted and its legal status has not yet been recognised.	65.41122397829442
I know no better than you if this Charter will become part of the Treaty or if it will be no more than a solemn declaration.	48.37721140647162
If this Charter should become part of the Treaty, it will of course be taken into account in future progress reports and we shall report on how the details of this Charter are being taken into account in the individual countries concerned.	50.30029046156489
We must also report in the progress reports - as you will have noticed - as to whether a country is complying with the Copenhagen criteria.	56.32178210600067
That basically answers the questions, because the political criteria of Copenhagen basically cover everything which will appear in this Charter of Fundamental Rights and these questions have also been answered in relation to Lithuania and will be answered in the next progress report on Lithuania.	53.757758648677196
Mrs Thors is raising a point of order.	21.44838457308102
I wish to point out that I was not earlier referring to Mrs Thors, but to all MEPs, but you have the floor.	54.43865451193992
I would ask you not to enter into a debate with the Commissioner.	43.708896660988984
Commissioner, I just want to clarify matters as there seems to be very bad interpretation - I was not talking about the Charter of Fundamental Rights but about the Social Charter including the rights of workers.	43.87658475468761
These include working conditions which I think are a corollary to the movement of services.	97.94607233409612
What are the conditions under which services are provided?	122.390102586513
What are the conditions under which people are working?	86.24550692140514
That is the corollary of free movement.	17.96302824664709
Mr President, I did indeed hear the words Charter of Fundamental Rights.	60.83415631613603
Of course, the Social Charter forms part of the Treaty and is therefore negotiated with all candidate countries.	39.85615265445306
It forms part of the Community acquis.	37.50756565487822
We report on how the individual candidate countries are preparing to apply the acquis, i.e. to apply the Social Charter.	50.93342664331375
I am not at the moment in a position to tell you exactly how things stand with Lithuania in particular, but I would be more than happy to give you a written reply specifically on Lithuania and the Social Charter.	76.27781487667028
Commissioner, we were in fact discussing the matter of transition periods.	46.154441096670936
I should like to ask what your position is on the wishes of Poland and the Czech Republic to introduce long transition periods for two areas of concern to them, namely the free acquisition of land, including farmland, and the freedom of establishment.	43.715503898954964
These are two very fundamental points and I should like to know what the Commission or your position is on this.	89.35201659451158
I also wanted to ask you what you think about linking transition periods in the Member States and the candidate countries in the sort of package deal that is constantly being discussed.	70.16071842102157
On the first question, I should like to say that the Member States still have no negotiating position on this question, nor is there any Commission draft on it.	53.23739223805348
My own personal opinion is irrelevant.	431.85051440799003
In any case, I cannot explain it to the European Parliament until the institutions have formed their own opinion.	44.07289254512787
As far as linking transition periods is concerned, this happens automatically.	39.94062465523023
We shall have a so-called "play off" at the end of the negotiations between the wishes which the Member States still have and the wishes which the candidates have.	63.07990458744579
Basically their wishes concern transition periods.	846.7926205751146
Irrespective of whether or not that is what it is formally called, you can imagine how this sort of negotiation process proceeds.	57.49882270994107
It will be a negotiation and one of the principles of negotiation is that one side makes a concession so that the other side also makes a concession and an overall compromise must be found in the end which takes accounts of the wishes of both sides.	74.10305997281475
Highly specific packages - if that was your question - whereby we also say: we are linking the wish for transition periods on the one side to the wish for transition periods on the other side are not feasible in my opinion.	53.5606077617546
I should draw your attention to the fact that the question of transition periods in relation to the free movement of workers, for example, only gives cause for concern in two of the fifteen Member States.	46.44689930621897
It is a German problem and it is an Austrian problem.	14.733754934760645
It is not a problem for the other thirteen which is why I cannot predict exactly how this issue will be handled in the final stage of negotiations.	34.30757191630378
Thank you very much, Mr Commissioner, for your replies.	38.60232649368083
Questions Nos 41 and 42 will be replied to in writing.	14.978859162933077
Mr Titley has the floor for a point of order.	38.528864182908485
- Mr President, you realise this is the second month running you have done this to me - cut me off as my question was coming up.	149.64727471183124
Yet you have allowed speakers to speak for over one minute including a rather long and pointless dialogue about the merits of Murcia.	144.1482984546651
Also in the rules as I recall, you are only allowed to take one supplementary question per political group and these rules are being broken and as a consequence, for the second week running, I miss out on a question.	58.66220212495138
I think it is absolutely outrageous and I will be writing to the President to complain.	25.192481378325258
Mr Titley, I will reply briefly so as not to inconvenience the other MEPs.	80.9574841304254
I am not getting at you.	742.1739542203258
What has happened is that the 20 minutes devoted to Mr Verheugen have run out and it is now Mr Monti' s turn to reply, and he has been waiting some time.	90.99177101895917
With regard to the Rules of Procedure, I must tell you that there are two supplementary questions, not one.	30.350850560956864
Please read the Rules of Procedure.	35.23749218249358
There are two questions.	60.25178476599438
I am not going to get into a debate.	93.2033346092421
You may write the letter you mentioned and you will receive a polite and full reply, but please do not worry since my intention was to give you the floor within the time allotted.	78.11939602468841
Question No 43 by (H-0354/00):	13.997010761389518
Subject: Applications by Member States regarding state aids Is the Commission happy about the speed with which it deals with applications by Member States to provide state aids?	91.72048975911419
The time-limits for the Commission to take a decision on aid projects notified by a Member State are laid down in Council Regulation 659/1999.	38.92885636412897
In most cases the Commission can close the examination of the notified aid project after the preliminary examination, that is without opening a formal investigation.	101.99779932740105
Such decisions must be taken within two months following the receipt of a complete notification.	58.363571213089074
In practice, notifications are frequently incomplete so that the Commission is forced to request additional information before it can take a decision.	36.346743258694815
In order to further reduce this type of unnecessary delay, the Commission has prepared detailed standard notification forms for certain types of aid - regional, training, R&D, etc. and will continue to do so where appropriate.	71.7669600302019
When doubts are raised about the compatibility of an aid project with the common market, the Commission must open a formal investigation for which the regulation provides an indicative time-limit of 18 months.	81.04648214902709
The Commission would certainly prefer to be able to reduce this time-limit.	29.311830645555844
However, this seems at present not feasible for different reasons.	134.09604236912452
Firstly, considerable time is needed for translation and publication of the decision, for third parties to submit observations and for the Member States to comment on these observations.	57.0502045342191
Secondly, the cases for which a formal investigation is opened are usually very complex and therefore require a longer period of examination, often also involving meetings with the Member State concerned and modifications to the original project.	140.78177833709384
Nevertheless, the Commission considers that given the absence of any time-limit for the formal investigation procedure before the regulation, the regulation has already brought some progress.	62.89317551355967
The Commission is also considering new ways of improving the efficiency and speed of state aid procedures.	130.5785811358811
In this regard, the group exemption regulations, which are currently being prepared for aid to SMEs - training aid and de minimis aid - should be mentioned.	61.421988218186144
Once they are in force, Member States will no longer need to notify aid projects complying with the conditions of the exemption regulations but can grant the aid immediately.	53.773412515429314
This will considerably simplify state aid procedures.	160.51914142780012
I wish to thank the Commissioner for that very full answer and, in particular, for the last part where he indicates that the Commission is looking at speeding up and, where possible, giving fast-track approval for state aids.	88.46795186521975
However, in some Member States there is still a serious problem created by delays in decision-taking on state aids.	60.234018878859445
I am convinced that some jobs have been lost because waiting for the decision on state aid has meant that a company has gone out of business in the end because it did not have the approval in time.	97.46935385306021
In terms of the delay, is the Commission of the opinion that the reorganisation that is currently going on will provide new resources and assistance to him in his attempts to speed up the processing of state aids, or does the problem lie, as he partly indicated, with the Member States in the inadequate information provided by some of them when they make an application?	66.03529021247071
As you know, Mr Martin, we are working in a number of directions concerning state aid and in order to make state aid control more stringent.	56.51830196332122
As to time limits, there are no plans to change the time limits in the near future.	85.27309795343064
The deadlines are laid down in a Council regulation, which for the first time codifies state aid procedures, and since that regulation was only adopted in 1999 it is not likely to be modified in the near future.	57.97792670430939
However, we are prepared and indeed willing to try to speed up certain aspects of the decision-making wherever possible, for example preparing the standard notification forms.	64.99017574317625
You mentioned the problem of resources.	37.22997095930576
Of course, this is a key problem for the whole of the competition policy activities and that includes state aid.	45.806159862030185
The better the quality of information provided to begin with by Member States in their notifications, the more likely it is that the process will be smooth and conducted in a relatively short time scale.	69.85420962573266
Question No 44 by (H-0355/00):	13.997010761389518
Subject: State aids to nuclear power Given that the electricity market came into effect in February last, subjecting all electricity production to the rules of the internal market, and that the nuclear common market under Article 92 of the Euratom Treaty does not include electricity as a product, does the Commission agree that electricity generated using nuclear energy is now subject to the same internal market rules as all other forms of electricity?	69.56680142196451
Does the Commission therefore consider that all state aids to the nuclear industry are prohibited by the EC Treaty, given that no derogation is specified, and that Article 98 of the Euratom Treaty does not provide for a subsidised accident insurance scheme for nuclear risks?	60.3587136015807
In this context what proposals, if any, has the Commission made to the UK Government concerning their NFFO system under Article 87 of the EC Treaty?	43.11622505718142
Can the Commission now confirm that it is investigating state aids to the nuclear industry as requested by the Green/EFA Group in its letter to Commissioner Monti of 10 March?	64.84131986177307
Mr President, the Commission shares the opinion of the honourable Member to the effect that the liberalisation of the electricity market affects all types of electricity, including electricity generated using nuclear energy.	41.939818025668295
The Commission considers that there are no grounds for interpreting the EC or the Euratom Treaty as necessarily prohibiting all state aids to the nuclear industry.	68.53767377222812
The Euratom Treaty does not include any clauses specifically prohibiting state aid.	60.57818129174056
Moreover, while Articles 87 and 88 of the EC Treaty do provide for a general principle prohibiting state aids, they also authorise specific categories of state aid.	74.17588958578816
It would only be possible to determine the incompatibility of aid following specific investigation of each case.	58.839903537254116
The Commission has not made any proposals to the UK Government on the subject of the NFFO system in application of Article 88 of the EC Treaty.	22.554540447045607
As regards any existing aid to the nuclear industry, the Commission is not undertaking any systematic investigation.	158.5546075556742
If, however, cases of incompatible aid are brought to the attention of the Commission, such cases will be dealt with in compliance with the terms of the relevant articles of the EC and Euratom Treaties.	40.531167256551505
Commissioner, thank you for your response, but I must admit I find it hard to grasp the logic of it.	64.27452814144353
On the one hand, regarding state aid to the environment, you expect to implement a very thorough analysis of the subsidies to renewable energies even though it is clear that, for the time being, this sector is at a disadvantage due to the internalisation of costs.	42.919724685963
In other words, the market share of renewable energies within the current electricity market is barely 5%.	69.8761713325668
Alongside that, nuclear energy amounts to 30% of the market but in this case you do not plan any systematic investigation.	67.56492835123636
I do not therefore see how we can possibly understand this, if the logic of your energy policy is supposed to be fair, treating all forms of electricity production alike.	54.84031134015584
I must therefore ask you to justify your position since, as far as I am concerned, and also many others, most especially the renewable energy industry, it is a position which is extremely difficult to comprehend.	79.48986650453408
Thank you, Mr Turmes.	7.294548066081386
I am very aware of environmental requirements, as I was even in the previous Commission, when I proposed the directive on the taxation of energy products, and I try to adopt the same approach in my activities within the Prodi Commission.	76.702528561392
I very clearly understand your concern, but permit me some observations.	205.64408105990756
The proposed new framework for state aid to the environment is very flexible with regard to the granting of aid to renewable energies.	92.3663270907698
It authorises aid of at least 40% of eligible costs in the case of investment, and for operational aid the Member States are entitled to adopt a system authorising aid up to 100% of eligible costs.	93.93097088676258
I do not think, therefore, that you can accuse the Commission of banning aid to renewable energies.	29.795494209729974
There is some competition, again permit me the observation, not only between renewable energies as opposed to conventional energies, but also between the various forms of renewable energies.	124.22512171863907
Aid to these forms of energy may, moreover, vary according to the Member States.	28.705226380803
Unregulated aid would therefore engender distortions of competition, which could have an adverse impact primarily on certain forms of renewable energy.	76.75449261684182
The Commission recognises that renewable energies may need support in order to be able to develop but, at the same time, it is also important for these forms of energy to adapt gradually to competitive markets in order to ensure their long-term development.	43.765382139646235
Question No 45 by (H-0383/00):	13.997010761389518
Subject: Financial aid given to the European nuclear industry What assessment has been made by the Commission of the financial aid given to the European nuclear industry - in the form of support for Euratom and the Joint Research Centres - in respect of competition policy on electricity production in the European Union?	35.92432852997087
Community action within the context of the Euratom Treaty complies with the provisions of the Treaty and relates, in particular, to the financing of the Commission's tasks: protection against radiation, monitoring safety and research.	29.052460426672457
As far as the latter is concerned, Community programmes for nuclear research are established by the Council which, pursuant to Article 7 of the Euratom Treaty, acts unanimously on Commission proposals.	54.843669022612055
In this context, the activities of the JRCs are intended, in conformance with its mission, to increase protection and nuclear safety, and in particular, provide scientific and technical assistance to the competent directorates-general.	53.12140722787287
Article 305 (ex Article 232) of the EC Treaty establishes that the provisions of this Treaty do not derogate from the Euratom Treaty.	14.588888415996887
This is particularly true in the case of the competition rules, which do not derogate from the framework established by the Euratom Treaty regarding Community nuclear research.	43.29271994345766
Therefore, the Community research policy under the Euratom Treaty does not contradict the competition rules laid down by the EC Treaty.	34.86929678472211
Commissioner, you have failed to answer my question.	51.388153609057404
I want to know what assessments you are making on financial aid.	125.48805121732971
This relates to the previous question by Mr Turmes as well and the answer you gave to that in respect of competition policy on electricity production in the EU.	60.876376713174466
I conclude from your answers both to my question and the previous one that here we have not just a white elephant in the nuclear industry in Europe but a holy cow.	89.63490125161492
You can provide state aids that are untouchable, even by a Commissioner as powerful as yourself!	94.29529488412642
But let me ask you what exactly is the situation?	59.32622502917434
You said that under the Treaties there are derogations - and you quoted the Euratom Treaty.	32.269813263267885
There is clearly a distortion between Member States because of the state aids.	50.95896229138906
Where exactly in the Treaty are the written permissions for these state aids?	118.56550689641004
Could you elaborate on that please?	50.55902888432184
I shall try, Mrs Ahern.	61.442688785517696
First of all, if you allow me, I have here a note in French.	94.97476256050314
I should like to emphasise that the Commission does not rule out applying the rules of Community law on competition to public interventions in favour of nuclear electricity producers.	65.2173970424914
In its illustrative nuclear programme according to Article 40 of the Euratom Treaty, in particular, the Commission very clearly indicated that "Developments towards the liberalisation of the Community internal electricity market will mean that nuclear energy will have to compete in the same framework and under the same conditions as all other energy sources."	72.57783896054717
A full implementation of the internal market and a rigorous application of the relevant state aid and competition rules implies a level playing field for all energy sources.	99.35968042251255
Once this principle has been established, it is up to the Commission to investigate on an individual basis any allegations according to which the nuclear sector is in receipt of subsidies engendering unfair competition.	42.906451296897146
I may add that the services I am directly responsible for within the Commission are of the opinion that it is necessary to keep to a strict interpretation of the Treaty.	69.74406798987252
Competition rules are applicable to all electricity producers, including the nuclear sector, insofar as they do not depart from the terms of the Euratom Treaty.	37.711747539558246
I consider this position to be all the more justifiable since the directive liberalising the internal electricity market does not stipulate any specific rule for nuclear producers and does not make any distinctions on the grounds of the source of the electricity produced.	55.96309087823776
Commissioner, you say that neither the Treaty nor the directive on the internal electricity market stipulate any exemptions regarding subsidies to the nuclear sector.	74.68742083098172
On what part of the Treaty, then, is the exemption that you are still allowing the nuclear industry based?	53.08725821144452
Articles 87 and 88 make no reference to nuclear energy.	78.34026639074106
So it is not very clear what your legal basis is for exemptions for electricity generated using nuclear energy.	68.02671837611265
I believe I have given you all the information available to the Commission on the subject.	89.51916998024353
I can add that, on the operational level, as indeed I think I said in response to your own question, Mr Turmes, on existing aid to the nuclear industry, the Commission is not undertaking a comprehensive investigation.	101.60141834493575
If, however, cases of incompatible aid are brought to our attention, then these cases will be dealt with in accordance with the terms of the two treaties.	50.19824450926548
I would further like to add that in the logical overall construction of the EC Treaty, the articles governing state aid, i.e. Articles 87 and 88, are not restricted to specific sectors.	57.17950327525315
Since the time allotted to Questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions Nos 46 to 83 will be replied to in writing.	22.34962055650294
That concludes Questions to the Commission.	9.66205456601853
(The sitting was suspended at 7.25 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)	56.57306398262312
Carbon dioxide emissions from new cars	69.49653587779483
The next item is the report (A5-0128/2000) by Mr González Alvarez, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council decision establishing a scheme to monitor the average specific emissions of CO2 from new passenger cars.	36.4356799290922
Mr President, there are few of us here at this time in the evening, but it is also true that this is the third time we have debated this report in the European Parliament.	33.48225431531236
On the first occasion, in December 1998, this report on the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions from new passenger cars was approved at first reading with 48 amendments.	39.60746805893768
Of those 48 amendments, the Council and Commission accepted some in their entirety and others only in part.	62.430611592666274
The report therefore returned for a second reading.	92.67619361856461
The Council had accepted certain amendments which we considered to be important, but there remained certain aspects of the report and the amendments approved unanimously in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy - and by a large majority in plenary session - which we also considered to be important and which had not been accepted.	52.063108116411875
We are basically talking about the inclusion, in this scheme to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from new cars, of lightweight industrial cars, which are used widely within cities and whose carbon dioxide emissions also pollute.	62.10244233117608
It also seemed to us that they had not included a guarantee of the quality of data.	58.01470101655496
For a scheme of this nature, rigour and comparability, in terms of the data collected by the governments, are essential.	25.002566558802204
It also seemed very important that we maintained something that was traditional in the positions of the Committee on the Environment: a certain degree of precaution in relation to voluntary agreements.	42.09835937722736
If we bear in mind that Community Law - directives and regulations - is often not complied with, it seems to us all the more unlikely that voluntary agreements will be complied with.	46.50590209110939
The Committee on the Environment had little faith in these voluntary agreements and another amendment asked for the establishment of a clear legal framework which would come into play in the event that the voluntary agreements failed.	69.29158278577954
They also finally accepted our concern that one of the paragraphs should not only mention the stabilisation of emissions, but also their reduction.	79.58804206882527
Another amendment which we felt was important concerned the dimensions of vehicles.	112.23611006900558
Mr President, in total, 10 amendments were approved by a substantial majority in this House and then not accepted by the Council, and we therefore had to embark on this conciliation procedure, which I must point out has been neither difficult nor controversial.	93.36494561165308
As its very name indicates, the conciliation procedures require each of the parties to give some ground so that a final agreement can be reached.	141.87707186021865
In this final agreement, our main concerns have been addressed.	100.34559784882389
It includes a study of the future inclusion of lightweight industrial vehicles, the possibility of shortly presenting a proposed legal framework and reviewing the data with a view to making them more rigorous and more or less equivalent in each of the countries.	75.07245905769639
In short, Parliament' s main concerns have been taken up, if not in an immediate and radical manner, at least to the extent that a commitment has been given to adopt decisions on this issue in the future.	75.83098247129959
The only amendment which was not accepted was the one relating to dimensions of vehicles.	157.32758036959922
Parliament continued to insist that this was very important because the more powerful and larger the vehicle, the greater its level of emissions, and we considered it important that this be included in one of the annexes.	73.31521270409735
However, bearing in mind that another six issues relating to the capacities and conditions of the vehicles have been accepted, we felt that we could not prolong the conciliation process any longer, particularly considering that we want this study on the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions from new passenger cars to be implemented immediately in each of the countries.	67.36924186787043
Finally, I believe that this is a reasonable agreement, which is neither Parliament' s nor the Council' s initial proposal.	79.63444239954433
Mr President, I believe that we will have no problem ensuring that this agreement is approved.	59.481010050574234
Mrs González Álvarez, conciliation processes vary in difficulty, I can assure you.	115.57933526844569
I am glad that this one has gone smoothly.	156.99491319760227
Mr President, Commissioner, allow me to start by congratulating Mrs González Álvarez.	24.293840255336004
She really is most persistent, because we had a very good report at second reading as it was, but she was determined to incorporate more proposed amendments and I really must congratulate her on succeeding in doing so.	89.53376123000417
Parliament has asserted itself against the Council once again.	80.37850604785463
The introduction of this sort of monitoring scheme is just one of the many steps on the path towards compliance with the Kyoto protocol.	71.16248899782704
Reducing greenhouse gases by 8% in comparison with 1990 is therefore the main objective between now and the year 2012.	62.38766044333453
The dramatic change in the climate has been noticeable here in Strasbourg over the past two days and is far greater than we assumed.	77.45271361087882
It will therefore come as no surprise if we adopt this report unanimously tomorrow, as will certainly be the case, and that the Council and Parliament have been able to find a common position so quickly.	44.78494522249358
This joint monitoring scheme is the first of its kind and I think that its success or failure will decide whether or not we opt to introduce other similar schemes.	195.2623708471441
We have taken recourse to a three-part strategy in order to reduce CO2 emissions and fuel consumption: environmental agreements with the car industry, a system of tax incentives and a system of labelling for fuel consumption and CO2 emissions.	27.05891483972879
But despite all these efforts, directives and joint measuring schemes, we should not delude ourselves: we are unlikely to achieve the target objective of reducing greenhouse gases to 1990 levels.	35.67594216588261
Some experts are advising us to try and stabilise emissions at present levels.	50.37064641047371
That may well be pessimistic but if we consider that the number of cars on the road is continuing to rise in the 14 Member States, oh excuse me, I meant 15; we Austrians often have to stop and ask ourselves if there are 14 or 15 Member States, but there are in fact still 15, and if we consider enlargement to the east and if we consider that people in China and India also want to live as we do, then we should make no mistake: it will be difficult to achieve a reduction in greenhouse gases or CO2 and we should therefore make every effort to stabilise them at the very least.	54.309324271212596
Despite all the pessimism, introducing a pan-European monitoring system for CO2 emissions will not do any harm.	51.79861729040286
Let us try yet again with one small step at a time and perhaps the House will sit in 2005, when we need to examine the initial results, and complain that perhaps we did not do enough today.	87.3118792163262
Mr President, Commissioner, trust is good, control is even better, as the Head of State of a now defunct system used to say.	38.28897459892874
Nonetheless, once in a while these words of wisdom fit the bill because our CO2 strategy for cars is of course a new departure in that we are trusting in the willingness of car manufacturers in Europe, Korea and Japan to take voluntary technical measures to reduce CO2 emissions from their cars to 140g by 2008, which will represent a reduction of around 25%.	49.932327379773525
But we do still need a control mechanism so that we can intervene if necessary.	87.62729918819682
Hence: trust is good, control is even better.	71.65812003881665
We want a statistically perfect control instrument at our disposal and in this respect I thank the rapporteur for her persistence in establishing a reasonable control instrument for CO2 emissions from cars in Europe which applies to all Member States, which clearly shows which vehicles are registered where and what their CO2 emissions are, so that we can see clearly in 2003 if the manufacturers' undertakings are being respected or not.	92.9432275505219
And if they are not, then we must take legislative measures.	56.8377078009273
I should like to refer to another two pillars in our strategy: the question of labelling, which has been dealt with and the question of additional tax incentives for low-consumption vehicles, which is still a somewhat weak point.	39.663504792786206
I think that all of us, especially of course the Member States, need to give clear additional incentives, so that we really can achieve our objective of 120 g in 2005.	58.83209826382518
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate our rapporteur on the excellent results that she has achieved and to begin by placing this report in the broader context of climate change.	55.33833397519631
Since the Rio de Janeiro Conference and then Kyoto, the European Union has always led the political side of the debate on climate change.	34.904643254439904
Nevertheless, although Europe continues to lead the debate in terms of rhetoric, it is beginning to lose the legitimacy to do so in a credible way.	44.53543681563732
It is rather pointless for the European Union to try to alarm the whole world with this problem when, in reality, the European greenhouse gas bubble, in particular the carbon dioxide bubble, is more likely to increase by 6% to 8% than to decrease by the 8% that we agreed in Kyoto.	30.063050107709966
It is therefore time to take internal action in order to lend credibility to our external efforts.	89.55982273093652
In terms of political action, the transport sector must be our priority for the following two fundamental reasons.	118.22098912609573
Firstly, because, according to the Green Paper published by the European Commission, this sector will not be part of the European trading system for carbon dioxide emissions, and all greenhouse gas reductions will therefore have to be achieved exclusively through national and Community policies and measures.	30.748126650330693
Secondly, because transport is the sector that is contributing most to Europe' s falling short of the levels set in Kyoto.	120.86764468719153
According to a study recently published by the European Environment Agency, transport is responsible for almost 30% of the European Union' s total emissions, and it predicts that the level of carbon dioxide emissions generated by this sector will increase by 39% of the 1990 level by 2010.	39.522804961379734
Given this extremely disturbing picture, which shows that road transport is responsible for 85% of total carbon dioxide emissions in the transport sector, and given the overwhelming need for action, the agreement reached in the Conciliation Committee on this system for monitoring CO2 emissions from light passenger vehicles is to be welcomed.	55.700009496396234
This system is a crucial aspect in the implementation of the Kyoto protocol and will ensure rigorous control of the voluntary commitment made by the car industry to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in new passenger vehicles by 25%.	59.08768102761983
I regret the fact that it has not been possible to include light commercial vehicles in this system.	99.93910961733418
In any event, I congratulate Mrs González Álvarez once again on the results she has achieved.	69.2977025008541
Mr President, Commissioner, I intend to be as brief as our successful rapporteur in the conciliation procedure.	123.09154685862791
However, let me just offer her my hearty congratulations on her excellent report and brilliant success, as some of the previous speakers have done.	52.64811036837461
Contrary to some previous speakers, I think it is most important that the report should seek not just to stabilise concentrations of greenhouse gases but to reduce them, especially given the fact that we need to achieve a demonstrable success by 2005 under the terms of the Kyoto protocol.	41.33885051018235
I think it is fundamental, given the reservation which this Parliament has always expressed in connection with voluntary obligations in environmental agreements, that we have managed to include the passage stating that data will be used from 2003 onwards to monitor the voluntary obligations of the car industry.	43.0995779427774
I also think that it is fundamental - and the scope is not extended by this decision - that we have managed to bring the Commission so far down the line that it is looking into implementing harmonised measurements for the specific CO2 emissions from class N1 vehicles and presenting proposals to this effect.	52.01503106518021
I think that is a huge success.	56.823118380267864
I should like once again to congratulate the rapporteur and vote in favour of this report.	33.86677317139647
Mr President, I welcome the excellent result reached by the European Parliament and the Council on this dossier.	48.389654943922594
I congratulate the co-legislators on their efforts in finding a swift and satisfactory agreement.	52.498470865103265
The process leading to the approval of this proposal constitutes a prime example of how the two arms of the European legislature can settle their differences and work together towards adoption of sound and effective environmental law.	99.43276216896298
I should like to seize the opportunity to thank the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection and, in particular, the rapporteur, Mrs González Álvarez, for its constructive approach.	18.013112339821618
The adoption of this decision will allow the effectiveness of the Community strategy to reduce CO2 emissions from passenger cars to be monitored and, more specifically, it will provide credible data to monitor the implementation of the voluntary agreements with car manufacturers.	42.16959299147733
This strategy is one of the most concrete activities of the Community on CO2 emissions and reductions from the transport sector.	41.07913543315581
Therefore it represents an important milestone in the achievement of the Kyoto target.	13.305353347428303
Mr President, unforgivably, I have forgotten something.	13.836256536081917
It will take me just 20 seconds to express my gratitude to all the members of the Conciliation Committee: to Mr Provan, to Mrs Jackson, who also participated, and to the members of the Commission and the Council with whom we worked in order to reach an agreement on the report.	31.37480319430927
Furthermore, I would like to thank all the MEPs for their support.	31.630513433102795
The debate is closed.	72.32022542053704
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.	47.382283419271545
Interoperability of the trans-European rail systems	22.848094695041766
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports, tabled by Mr Savary on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism:	19.747630792330945
(A5-0112/2000) on the report from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on the implementation and effects of Directive 96/48/EC concerning the interoperability of the trans-European high-speed rail system;	17.51304320453635
(A5-0113/2000) on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on the interoperability of the trans-European conventional rail system.	11.120774502001101
Mr President, I hope that the two members due to speak before me were not travelling by train and have been delayed.	68.95948742997884
I think they are in the House and will arrive in time.	39.84206427194117
Unfortunately, the fact of the matter is that we are fighting numerous problems on the railways which are a legacy from the past.	33.2637387512797
For example, in 1970, the railways' share of the freight traffic market was 21%, compared with just 8.5% now.	29.721112626323784
The railways have lost out massively in freight traffic and their share of the passenger traffic market has fallen from 10 to 6%.	51.19864206558728
The winner has been road freight traffic, which is increasing constantly and winning market shares: 16% per annum on the eastern borders of Austria, for example.	75.67347893730872
It is now 2.4 times higher than in 1990.	104.77887289794353
If you take lorries and buses from eastern Europe on the A1 motorway, which is the most important east-west route, traffic increased sixfold between 1995 and the year 2000.	44.306687763375734
In other words, freight traffic, especially transit freight traffic, is growing massively.	41.70106026192819
According to forecasts, it will rise by more than 100% between 1995 and 2015.	96.08224595255334
That is why it is important and urgent that we concern ourselves with the European rail network.	37.98599071502215
It totals 156 000 kilometres in length, of which 78 000 km are accounted for by the TEN network.	23.436526945972844
12 600 km of new lines for speeds of over 250 km/h should be constructed by 2010, with at least 16 300 km of lines due to be upgraded for speeds of over 200 km/h. The total costs - and they are huge - are estimated at EUR 186 billion between now and 2010.	54.3204585727187
So it is obvious how important this investment is for the European Union and that is why we are being called on here to set the priorities quickly.	63.71158990152582
I think that it is high time we adapted the railways to the market economy, so as to ensure that the railways invest more money more often in customer requirements and that we can jointly set the priorities and draw up a tight, efficient timetable.	71.47594470518254
The main requirements are, of course, to harmonise the gauge throughout Europe, especially where more than two countries cooperate.	104.88590524197858
At the moment, we still have five different gauges.	89.12488961374837
We need uniform electrification, especially in relation to voltage and frequency.	72.39402347299456
In other words, the technical properties of the electricity must be brought into line so that extra electricity can be bought from the national grids and fed into the national grids without any significant losses.	34.76266140240248
The third, and I think the most important point is the safety of trains.	49.69801550268181
We really do need external inspection and certification agencies.	345.5327204767335
We cannot have a situation in which the agency operating the railway is also responsible for inspecting it.	25.564733623811954
No-one questions the fact that cars and lorries are inspected by external certification agencies.	59.404289781233174
I think there is an urgent need, given the recent train crashes, for external inspection agencies to look after the safety of passengers in Europe.	80.05779194969075
Mr President, first of all I should like to thank all the Members who supported the rapporteur in his work in presenting these two reports which are, I believe, absolutely crucial to the future of the railways.	49.814559346614615
What is the subject matter?	43.08261988581226
The first report analyses the application of the 1996 Directive on the interoperability of the high-speed rail system, drawing the lessons of this for the future.	28.061486483229178
Next, and this is the substance of the second report, we must discuss and vote on a proposed directive on the interoperability of the trans-European conventional rail system.	25.61890721124599
Ladies and gentlemen, we must appreciate the full importance of this subject.	43.03134109135247
There is today an unacceptable contradiction between what is said in speeches and the reality of European transport systems.	79.97698789334021
As might have been expected, the creation of the internal market has, logically, considerably developed the trade in goods and the mobility of persons within the Union, which have shown an increase of 21% and 15% respectively between 1990 and 1997.	31.633881107311087
The bulk of the traffic from this explosive growth in internal mobility, which is expected to be consolidated in the next few decades, has been acquired by road systems and, secondarily, maritime cabotage via the North Sea.	36.43304680493919
At a time when we have right here, in most of the countries of the Union, a rail network and technology unparalleled in the world, with a recent study evaluating the external costs of road transport in terms of public health, infrastructure and pollution at some EUR 480 billion, even though the objective of sustainable mobility and respect for quality of life are now shared by all Europeans, it can be noted that rail has only an 8.6% market share for freight, and 5.8% for passenger transport.	67.11531778708068
There is more than one explanation for this paradox: rail' s reduced level of competitiveness due to a social differential in relation to the road sector, but also the distortions of competition engendered by the considerable external costs of road transport, the priority which most major railway companies in recent years have given exclusively to prestigious high-speed passenger transport, but also excessive national characteristics in terms of railway traditions, techniques and protocols, thereby compromising the flow of continental rail traffic.	57.693234885214586
Today, the situation of the European transport network situation is simple to the point of caricature: there is only one common area in transport and that is the road network.	87.71931541441518
There is no longer any single airspace or European maritime area, nor especially a continuous railway area within the countries of the Union.	55.18344505261286
The issue at stake in railway interoperability is, of course, doing away with the technical frontiers that have been inherited from the national railway structures set in place gradually since the nineteenth century.	51.98292665109644
Today, the Europe of the Fifteen has no less than sixteen electric signalling systems, six electrical voltages, five track gauges and several equipment and therefore infrastructure gauges.	36.81634163359064
Of course, the new high-speed train infrastructures offer a prime area for the introduction of interoperability, since they are new or recent networks devoted to very similar technology.	95.43393207030506
Directive 96/48 was adopted for this purpose.	46.95659911385687
The report on its application, four years on, referred to Parliament to express an opinion, delivers contrasting results, but results that are in the end more positive than they may seem.	83.22402380318314
In the first place, significant delay is observed in the transposition of laws and regulations since, to date, only two countries have transposed it and the first technical specifications for interoperability are on the point of being completed and published.	54.081467124003154
The conclusion is therefore that the time limits for transposition and publication must be more stringent in future.	44.7283815969066
This delay in transposing into law has not, however, hindered the development of interoperable cross-border lines, although Thalys is the only example of true interoperability, more so than even Eurostar, despite its attempts to solve the gauge problem.	74.2926532644682
These two international lines have established a precedent which can serve as a model for future developments.	103.49160604388712
More than that, however, in anticipation of tangible results in future, the directive on the interoperability of high-speed routes has primarily made it possible to define and iron out working methods.	54.24187993235314
For the first time, the railway industry, rail companies and infrastructure managers have started up a joint project to define the technical specifications for interoperability.	62.59999686817228
They have worked on the basis of the most general studies by the International Union of Railways.	34.611717500459555
Within the European Association for Railway Interoperability (EARI) they have set up a working group which now has methods and experience available for transposition to conventional systems.	56.390188413161475
Finally, the Committee established by Article 21, bringing together representatives of the Member States and the Commission, enables political and technical monitoring of interoperability projects and intervention at the discretion of states to direct such projects.	67.98482341012793
In other words, while the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism felt bound to remind the Member States of their obligations in terms of time limits and transposition, it must be admitted that the high-speed systems have provided a first-rate testing ground for the vast worksite of interoperability.	43.40870018861763
In this respect, we have to bear in mind that the network and the conventional stock present problems for harmonisation that are formidable in other ways, due to the national and historical characteristics of networks, the great diversity of the stock, and the considerable extent of the networks.	48.42391451374773
It must be made quite clear at this point that there is no question of insisting that rail companies and infrastructure managers immediately proceed to replace their equipment comprehensively. This is totally out of reach, economically.	64.69138826305814
In the first place, if the goal is to achieve interoperability, this must entail using the fastest and least costly means to achieve decisive progress.	72.47879835620124
In this respect, interoperability may be achieved by methods other than the harmonisation of equipment, since it is possible to adapt equipment to operate in different configurations, following the example of the quadruple-system locomotives.	51.800858553867386
This is a proposal for a pragmatic and realistic approach which would not detract from railways' competitiveness in relation to other modes of transport by imposing additional costs.	42.762716741601345
In other words, there are safety valves for countries with a high level of special characteristics, and, within the institutions stipulated by the directive, they still have the opportunity to argue the case for these special characteristics and to have them included in the studies and in the TSI publications.	48.45141959547765
Finally, during the transition period, it is important to prevent the networks from growing further apart.	82.75977120533433
To this end, new investments, between now and the publication of the TSIs, shall have to comply with authorised technical references.	73.6138284825458
A Union rolling-stock register will be set up, making it possible to identify the rolling stock, its renewal and ageing, in the same way that this is still carried out, albeit imperfectly, for the maritime fleet.	35.89157307557438
Furthermore, we have to look to the future and, therefore, both the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy have proposed involving candidate country representatives in the projects at this early stage, so that they can anticipate this future acquis communautaire.	47.732174014091214
Similarly, and this is a recommendation that we make, we should already be planning conditions of interoperability between the various modes of transport, in accordance with our general objective of developing intermodal interoperability.	54.90573464664267
It would, of course, be presumptuous to expect everything to be achieved by this directive and the long-term upgrading work it requires from railway operators.	46.993505060603574
Quite clearly Europe is proposing to undertake a long-term and very large-scale project throughout its vast railway network.	80.98884507564493
It cannot single-handedly solve the problem of distortions of competition or of network access or charges which would represent crucial progress towards a new golden age of rail in Europe.	122.38566700040036
All the same, the technical interoperability of our old national networks is indeed an essential condition for the recovery of rail, which this balanced, reasonable and flexible text should make possible to achieve in gradual phases under acceptable economic and social conditions.	116.67789048021255
To the many of you who contributed to this, let me reiterate my gratitude and my appreciation.	64.58428062192839
Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Savary, and all the members involved for their excellent and constructive cooperation on this difficult, purely technical subject.	48.578104578971626
The number of proposed amendments tabled, including here in plenary, shows how important this issue is for Europe, which is why I can also praise the Commission for addressing the subject of the interoperability of conventional trains as well as of high-speed trains.	42.43273979259278
I think it is a pity that few Member States have transposed the interoperability directive with regard to high-speed trains and I call on the Commission to exert pressure to prevent the loss of valuable time which is costing the railways in terms of market shares and competition.	34.19732923416669
The directive is even more important where conventional trains are concerned.	61.45854453627276
The aim of the directive - as with high-speed trains - is to harmonise technical provisions in order to ensure that conventional rail traffic within the Union runs as smoothly as possible and to give candidate countries really exact specifications so that through traffic is also guaranteed after enlargement.	44.56801327107122
Interoperability will also have many advantages for both passengers and freight transport.	33.53884836311892
Better services, greater comfort, less travelling time, increased safety and possibly also lower prices.	146.66867845496128
The harmonisation of technical standards is also needed for the long overdue liberalisation of the railways.	64.44274854188353
Both together, interoperability and liberalisation, are most important if the railways are to survive in the internal market.	24.879364858322663
I am delighted that we have succeeded with the rapporteur and numerous other members in finding a good, common line on most aspects of this very demanding subject and would like to thank them for that.	89.82470988462514
This applies above all to the initially highly disputed derogations from the TSIs, but also to the social dimension of this directive, where we were finally able to achieve a compromise.	48.40434212069248
Nonetheless, - and we in the group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats continue to believe that we are right here - generally-worded social aspects do not belong in this purely technical directive, even if the Commission and the Council may think otherwise.	39.91699470707466
We are likewise opposed to involving passengers in working out TSIs.	154.09105786347544
Including these aspects will only result in the directive being difficult or impossible to manage.	114.81307195893658
Finally, a few other proposed amendments have been tabled, which we consider are quite simply too bureaucratic and have no positive aspects to boot.	99.8710230911396
In short, our group is against any elements which are counterproductive when it comes to achieving the important objective of an efficient European railway, as outlined above.	56.34975415450449
Allow me in closing to highlight the excellent cooperation once again; I am optimistic that together we shall achieve the objective of creating as smooth a railway system as possible.	128.45269982679713
) Mr President, I would first like to congratulate Mr Savary on his drafting of such excellent reports.	70.94267480812242
This is an important topic, but also an extremely complicated one.	23.852820866337336
Mr Savary has taken good account of the views of others.	34.277215387489704
My group supports improvement of the competitiveness of railways and liberalisation of competition.	128.6916079692165
The first stage is to create the conditions for uninterrupted movement of trains over the entire region of the European Union.	49.65791132835903
Technical Specifications for Interoperability (TSIs) and common standards are a sine qua non for the development of railway interoperability.	34.66358474145951
The rapporteur has quite rightly adopted a gradual approach.	127.5942045601673
Technical solutions can vary a great deal.	62.81032076406635
The competitiveness of railways should not be undermined by the imposition of additional economic burdens, even though common standards will lower costs in the longer term.	90.2683966015938
Existing differences between national railway systems will make necessary some exceptions in the harmonisation of railway systems, so that no Member State shall have to face inordinate difficulties and so that current railway transport will not be jeopardised.	74.49373087361793
This report outlines a course of action by which these exceptions can be accepted without jeopardising the principal objective.	63.524761302008564
There is one further matter which would require fine tuning; this was outlined in Amendment No 35 by my Group.	121.9168104805436
It applies to Finland in particular, but some of the applicant countries will be faced with the same problem in connection with enlargement of the Union.	32.61130602328459
The matter referred to concerns Russian freight wagons, where technical solutions are applied which differ from those of the Member States, inter alia in the area of couplings and brakes.	60.114816672578876
They are not necessarily inferior, but different.	42.54196818324295
Russia is hardly about to change its standards in order to comply with the requirements of the Union.	57.070381720685894
For Finland, this is an exceptionally major issue.	28.371378555588258
Due to historical reasons, the track gauge in Finland and Russia is the same, but it is different from that in Europe in general.	23.160337722650517
Russian wagons account for approximately 40 % - almost a half - of Finnish freight transport.	82.64637845716906
The reason for this high percentage is that we do not want to take the risk of sending Finnish wagons to Russia, since experience shows that they are so very rarely returned.	41.294162565212766
Russia, of course, is a country which leans heavily on rail transport, with a rolling stock which must equal that of the entire region of the EU put together	74.82029756803254
In the review concerning point 5 of Article 5, Mr Savary proposes that when considering special cases, particular attention should be paid to the rolling stock of third countries.	158.4541129175066
This proposal is very good, but the solution remains half-finished, as far as Finland is concerned.	48.5590294395964
It will lead to unnecessary and laborious inspections of Russian wagons and to massive bureaucracy.	26.09534528801879
There is no certainty either that Russian wagons in all instances would be regarded as special cases.	74.6891098111779
This is why we have tabled an amendment of Article 7, which simply aims at making it possible to use third country freight wagons for traffic, as long as they do not cross the border between two Member States.	92.62282843881452
This is the addition referred to as point f in the Committee' s amendment. Implementation of this proposal would give assurance that rail traffic in Finland could continue without becoming drastically reduced.	73.0099697859712
Mr President, Environment Commissioner, I am pleased that you are here because we can now address this matter straight away.	61.60996149647822
We are evidently debating a highly technical subject matter, namely the interoperability of both high-speed and conventional rail systems.	57.197312418299376
This gives me the opportunity to make a few comments on the environmental dimension to this proposal.	43.8351745944726
Today, we are essentially witnessing one of many historic moments which those who work in the sector, as well as those who are in favour of trains, have waited for for a long time, because at the end of the day, all this is, of course, meant to culminate in technological harmonisation, which entails the harmonisation of international rail, labour organisations, train drivers who have to make international rail journeys, etc. This also means that employers' organisations and trade unions will have an entirely different role and outlook with respect to this work.	47.84711126189199
In short, the proposal has a knock-on effect on many other areas and it will be some time before it is a reality.	41.44054834685478
Certainly if I look at the high-speed link and its technical specifications, I share Mr Savary' s view - who has drawn up an excellent report - that it is scandalous that three, nearly four years after the previous directive on interoperability of the high-speed link, we are still waiting for technical specifications for interoperability.	59.29814263143254
This does not bode well at all for the future.	46.91805696631411
What we are aiming for in the long run with this rail proposal is to attempt to cut down on traffic jams but also, more importantly, to benefit the environment, safety and a number of other aspects.	50.39553663840335
It has to be said, and I have already mentioned this several times within other fora, that the rail system is gradually losing its environmental edge, not so much because it does not take any initiatives itself, but more so because we ourselves prescribe few, if any, specifications for example, regarding the use of diesel-electric locomotives, the type of electricity used, etc.	55.898532696985335
What we would like, and this is why we welcome with open arms the dual speed for technical specification requirements, is for this technical specification to at least take account of energy consumption and air pollution, something which will require a great deal of hard work.	72.36364201482547
The second important point is of course the social dimension, as I touched upon a moment ago.	86.58595861130429
I regret that we are confining ourselves to the bare minimum, i.e. working conditions.	39.057056277069606
We refer to a social dialogue but we should really take it one step further, because this affects the entire labour organisation of railways.	144.43292134045325
I would urge you to look into the positive experiences which certain countries have had in changing the labour organisation of the rail system, in order to bring about a more efficient rail system and to set up exchange programmes, so that we can learn from experiences in countries which have struggled in the past, and which are often still struggling where other elements of the rail dossier are concerned, such as liberalisation or fair pricing.	55.80803561334511
Mr President, despite European integration, the rail system is disintegrating.	24.58202046216944
It is increasingly hard to obtain international rail timetables and it is often the case that train tickets to remote destinations have to be bought outside the country of departure.	68.93804731929431
Not so long ago, it was possible to take a direct train from Cologne to Athens, from Paris to Lisbon or from Amsterdam to Copenhagen.	41.16103120085282
This is now a thing of the past.	38.951911427298676
Meanwhile, railways are, however, in the process of being re-discovered.	14.322765241217194
The times when trains were seen as a burden inherited from the nineteenth century, something that can be neglected and dismantled, are fortunately over.	48.635784966970505
Almost everyone admits that trains should once again play a key role in European long-haul transport for people and goods alike.	101.73509363122773
This is not just necessary to meet the increasing demand for transport options, but mainly to curb the tide of cars and aeroplanes which form a threat to the environment.	48.52683639401027
The views on how to modernise the rail system are strongly divided.	65.40876048267022
For a long time, it was fashionable to apply everything that had contributed to the emergence of cars and aeroplanes to trains.	41.19650057234488
According to this line of thinking, everything should come down in price and should become flexible, so that price-based competition has a less detrimental effect on trains.	101.97920302397674
Some people still advocate that everything should be privatised and liberalised, that the influence of trade unions must be restrained and that railway personnel should perform more work for lower wages.	47.01470570409385
According to the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, these remedies are worse than the disease.	12.172948027344352
These would reportedly lead to further decay of the railway business and deterioration in the quality of services, and would force personnel to strike more, for reasons of self-preservation.	41.11057306326447
The real solutions must be sought in a completely different direction. For starters, there should be better cooperation between the existing national railway companies in the management of frequent and fast cross-border routes.	43.35085238083679
In the case of the conventional railway system, the routes Brussels to Amsterdam, Hamburg to Copenhagen and Dublin to Belfast are good examples of this.	19.754608680221466
The passengers are unaware that it is two companies who are responsible for this one joint and frequent link.	50.87481755014673
This could also apply to the extensions of the French high-speed links in England, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany which are running under the names "Eurostar" and "Thalys".	20.86197843786972
To guarantee success, it is important not to bring in a whole ream of new commercial businesses, which would lead to bad connections and variable pricing.	47.846937935365744
Furthermore, the money to finance such a high-speed network should not be found through cutting down services on short-haul routes in the individual Member States, as many people are indignant - and rightly so - about the huge amount of funding being ploughed into fast connections for the benefit of a small, privileged minority.	49.4519252064482
The construction of new high-speed links will continue to meet with protest if the ordinary domestic train user only ever experiences higher prices and fewer facilities and if they do not solve the environmental problems caused by cars and aeroplanes.	66.85461158301372
Needless to say, technology should be better harmonised by means of common mains voltage, joint equipment, fewer changes for passengers at borders and uniform safety requirements.	94.04982590229399
Privatisation and fragmentation according to the British model offer no guarantee whatsoever that those improvements could be better accommodated than if we were to keep the present state enterprises.	148.39560261212097
The position of the one million employees in the European rail system must be protected.	81.63496375063598
