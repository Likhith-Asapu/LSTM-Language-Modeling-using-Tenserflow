Implementation of LSTM language model using Tensorflow in Python. 

## Requirements

* Python 2.7
* Tensorflow 0.8.0
* Numpy

## Code Testing

The code has been tested on the following corpora:
- EuroParl Corpus

## File Structure 

Perplexity scores for sentences present within EuroParl Corpus can be found in the Perplexity_Scores folder.

- Perplexity_Scores/LM_train contains the perplexity scores for sentences used for training the model.
- Perplexity_Scores/LM_test contains the perplexity scores for sentences used for testing the model.

Model.ipynb contains the code for the LSTM language model.
